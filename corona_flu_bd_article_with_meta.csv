We will consider it in future if necessary,” came the health minister’s response. Government officials or public university teachers’ foreign tours have made headlines a number of times as they have travelled abroad spending millions of takas from the national exchequer for reasons like mastering the skills of digging pond, or purchasing things like elevators or increasing project capabilities.","Government officials, foreign trip, China coronavirus, health minister, Zahid Maleque"

Seven Bangladeshis hospitalised with fever on arrival from Wuhan amid coronavirus outbreak,01 February 2020 01:34 PM,"The authorities have put in hospitals in Dhaka eight of the 312 Bangladeshis evacuated from the Chinese city of Wuhan, the locked down epicentre of a deadly coronavirus outbreak that has sparked a global health emergency.","A special flight of Biman Bangladesh Airlines ferrying the evacuees arrived at Shahjalal International Airport sometime after 11:50am on Saturday, said Tahera Khandaker, a spokeswoman for the flag carrier. The eight passengers were sent to two hospitals after health workers detected fever, Shahriar Sazzad, a health officer at the Dhaka airport, said. The rest of the evacuees were taken to the Ashkona Hajj Camp, where they will be quarantined for 14 days, the incubation period of the new virus.

Condition of Bangladesh quarantine camp for Wuhan returnees raises fears of infection,02 February 2020 06:30 AM,The Bangladeshis evacuated from coronavirus-hit city of China were relieved when they landed in Dhaka with many flashing the victory sign from the airtight buses but their delight soon turned into fear of infection that they had thought was over.,"They are spending the nights on mattresses on the floors of the Ashkona Hajj Camp - a facility used to keep pilgrims before departure but now to quarantine the returnees from Wuhan – near Shahjalal International Airport amid cold. Eight of the 312 returnees were sent to hospitals as they had flu symptoms similar to those of coronavirus, and the rest now fear that, with limited washroom facilities at the camp, anyone carrying the new virus in an incubated state can spread it. “Many of us are using only one toilet. It has only one bucket. But it is necessary to keep clean to prevent the disease,” one of the evacuees, Reza Sultanuzzaman, told bdnews24.com via a mobile phone app. Reza, an assistant professor at Nanchang University, said the Bangladeshi authorities were not even following rules of quarantine, which he said means “total isolation”. The mosquito menace has made the situation worse, adding fears of dengue fever, he said. “It seems we are facing more danger here than we we did there. They [authorities] said the condition will improve gradually. But it’s not something to improve day by day. They should have arranged everything before we arrived,” he said. A researcher of another university at Wuhan, requesting anonymity, said they were feeling helpless after being put in the camp. “No one has provided us with a mask. Men, women, children, all have been kept at the same place. Everyone had been advised to drink at least two litre s of water a day, but we got only two half-litre bottles per head. There’s no provision for hot water either,” the researcher said. He also said no one conducted any medical test on them at the camp until 7pm though they had been told that they would frequently undergo the tests. “A doctor now tells me they won’t conduct medical check-up unless someone shows the symptoms. They should not keep us here if they don‘t conduct the tests,” he added. “He has been kept along with seven others in a room. My son will get infected if someone else carries the virus. I am worried,” he said. Sharifuzzaman, the father of another returnee, Sadman Sharif, is happy that his son has returned. “The condition at his university there was not bad. But it can’t be said how the situation would develop. So I had asked him to come. Now I have no worries,” he said. Mushtuq Husain, who has recently retired as the chief scientific officer at the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research, said generally not so many people are kept together in quarantine. “But we had to do it because we don’t have any structured quarantine facility,” said Mushtuq, whom the government’s diseases arm IEDCR is consulting to deal with the evacuation and isolation of the Bangladeshis. “There will be no problem because anyone else cannot get in from outside. And if someone shows the symptoms, he or she will be in total isolation,” he added. Abul Kalam Azad, the director general of health services, said they had tried their best to make it a “true quarantine”. A joint medical team of the directorate and the Combined Military Hospital had been assigned to work at Ashkona round the clock, he said. He also said not all the evacuees would have to remain at the camp for 14 days – the incubation period of the new virus. “We will assess them. If we see there’s no cause for concern, they will be released earlier than schedule,” he said.",Bangladesh

Bangladeshi describes her lonely fight to prevent coronavirus in Wuhan,02 February 2020 09:56 PM,One of the few Bangladeshis who have stayed back in the Chinese city of Wuhan after the evacuation of 312 nationals has described how the thoughts of preventing a coronavirus outbreak have occupied her mind.,"Jannatun Nahar Liza, a Bangladeshi PhD researcher in Huazhong University of Science and Technology, says her days there are “not so bad but lonely”. “Many of my compatriots and Chinese friends have left and I don’t know exactly when they can come back and when I can go out. I miss them a lot, hope they are healthy,” she told bdnews24.com in an email on Sunday. Her research is related to carbon molecules at the university’s College of Materials Science and Engineering. The Chinese city of Wuhan has been empty since Jan 23 as many people left for the spring festival before the start of a lockdown clamped to prevent a deadly coronavirus from spreading further, she said. “No one has come back, and it looks like Wuhan and I are having the longest, never- ending spring festival,” Liza said. The eerie silence has made her everyday life “very simple and lazy” but she is still trying to keep herself active by joining a volunteer group that provides free foods to the international students. Liza has opted for the morning duty. “It’s really hard to get up in the morning amid winter cold, but the responsibility for the group pushes me to get up early in the morning. It is also helping me do my morning exercise along with my work,” she said. To reduce the risk of infection, she takes a hot bath after the work. “This bath is the best part of the day and very refreshing.” By midday, she is served her lunch by other fellow volunteers. “I have my lunch while listening to some music. Then I walk a bit inside my room, hoping that this simple exercise will boost my energy and immunity to fight infection if I contract the virus,” Liza said. “But after 15 minutes of walk, I am always taking a nap, probably affected by the laziness. Sometimes even music feels so boring. After the nap, I freshen up and have some snacks or fruits, which I hope will do good to my health as well,” she added. By 4:30-5pm, her dinner is served to her room. It’s a Chinese tradition to finish dinner by 5pm, she said. She still couldn’t get used to the system so she saves her dinner for 8pm. “This makes the evening really lazy and long. Sometimes my friends come to accompany me, which is very rare at this time.” Liza said she goes out for a walk to buy fruits or snacks from nearby shops when she gets too bored. “I spend the days thinking about ways to keep myself healthy and strong while doing other things.” She said the “hardest part” is that she cannot touch her cat anymore as it is strictly forbidden to go near animals to reduce the risk of infection. “She lives inside my residence and follows me wherever I go but I just can’t pat her like before. It saddens me. (But) I am happy when I watch her eat,” Liza said.","Jannatun Nahar Liza, Bangladeshi PhD researcher, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China, coronavirus outbreak, International students in China"

Bangladeshi students in Yichang appeal for evacuation amid coronavirus lockdown,07 February 2020 09:29 PM,"A group of Bangladeshi students stuck in Yichang, a city in Hubei province of China, have appealed for evacuation citing a shortage of food and lockdown for a coronavirus outbreak.","As many as 172 Bangladesh nationals studying at the Three Gorges University in the locked down city have been affected by the restrictions, according to some of them. They said they want to return home like the 312 Bangladeshis who had been evacuated from Wuhan, another city some 285 kilometres from Yichang and at the heart of the epidemic. “We are short on food and drinking water. The situation is getting more miserable by the day,” said Abu Saleh, a civil engineering student at the university. He urged the foreign ministry and the Bangladesh Embassy in China to urgently arrange their exit from the city. “We want to return to Bangladesh.” Saleh said they cannot go out of their residential hall as the entire city is under lockdown with public transport, shops, banks and other services suspended for over two weeks. The university has also been shut. Photo: Faysal Ahmed Anik Photo: Faysal Ahmed Anik Most of the infections and deaths occurred in Wuhan, from where Bangladesh brought back the 312 nationals on Feb 1. The evacuees are under observation in isolation. Those stranded in Yichang say the nearby cities were in the same state as Wuhan but the media were not giving any importance to the condition of the other cities. “Even the food supplied by the university authorities from the canteen is not enough,” said Dwin Muhammad Priyo, another student of the Three Gorges University. Photo: Faysal Ahmed Anik Photo: Faysal Ahmed Anik “Whenever we contact people in Bangladesh, they say a decision to bring us back has been taken and the embassy has been informed. But the embassy officials say they are awaiting a decision from back home. This is confusing. Our only wish now is to return home,” he added. Faisal Ahmed Anik, a mechanical engineering student at the university, said they have holed up in their rooms for 20 days. “Now there is a shortage of food and water. We are getting stuff we require urgently three to four days later,” he said. Anik also said the US, the UK, India, Nepal, Morocco, Afghanistan and Uzbekistan have brought back their nationals from the university. “But we see no such effort for us,” he said. Khairul Bashar, the first secretary at the embassy, denied the allegations against it as well as the students’ claim about a lack of food and water. Photo: Faysal Ahmed Anik Photo: Faysal Ahmed Anik “They are ordering rice, lentil, salt, onion to cook themselves at the dormitory. But it takes time. It’s impossible for the university to provide at once whatever the students want in this situation.” Asked why an embassy official left the social media group of the students, Khairul said, “Anyone can enter the group for information and then leave. I see no problem here.” “Would we be able to keep our jobs if we defied (orders from) Dhaka?” he asked, in response to another allegation. After the evacuation from Wuhan, Cabinet Secretary Khandker Anwarul Islam said on Feb 3 that 171 more Bangladeshis were stranded due to the lockdown. The government “wants to bring them back”, but the problem is about who will fly and crew the plane, the secretary had said. “No country is letting in the pilots of the Wuhan flight. There have been discussions on the issue. If we can find a plane to charter, that will be the best option. And in that case Chinese planes will be the first preference,” he had added.","Yichang, Bangladeshi students, Three Gorges University, Hubeio, coronavirus, lockdown"
Bangladesh to screen all inbound travellers amid coronavirus scare,08 February 2020 01:09 PM,Temperature screening measures at airports and other ports of entry into Bangladesh have been extended to cover all inbound travellers in a bid to prevent a deadly coronavirus from spreading.,"The Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research or IEDCR, the  government’s disease wing, announced the move at a media briefing on Saturday. Previously, only travellers arriving in the country from China were required to undergo screening tests. But the virus has killed over 700 people since its outbreak in China's Wuhan late last year and cases have since been confirmed in 25 countries around the world. Meerjady Sabrina Flora, the director of IEDCR, said all planes arriving at airports in the country are being screened in an effort to stem the virus as it can be transmitted from one person to another.""It would have been enough to screen passengers arriving from China and a few other countries. But we have expanded the measure to cover travellers on all flights as an extra precaution.""The new screening procedure came into effect on Friday and is set to continue until further notice, according to Flora.On whether Bangladesh has the capacity to conduct screening at all ports of entry, Flora said: ""We are working collaboratively with different airlines. They are helping distribute health declaration forms inflight. Their assistance is very important.""""We are supplying handheld scanners to ports that don't have thermal scanners. Both handheld and thermal scanners work in the same way.""Aside from undergoing thermal screening, air travellers are also required to fill in health cards at airports.Travellers found with body temperatures higher than 100 degrees Fahrenheit are initially being kept in an observation room at the airport and later transferred to Kurmitola Hospital if necessary.Passengers coming into the country from China are being asked to contact the IEDCR if they suffer from fever within 14 days from arrival.As many as 8,484 people have undergone screenings as of Saturday, according to the IEDCR.

Bangladesh scraps plans to evacuate 171 nationals from locked-down Chinese cities,08 February 2020 07:41 PM,The failure to arrange a flight has forced the government to scrap its plans to bring back 171 Bangladeshis from the locked-down cities in China amid a deadly coronavirus outbreak.,"Foreign Minister AK Abdul Momen revealed the decision to the media after an event in Dhaka on Saturday as the death toll from the disease passed 700 in China with more than 34,000 confirmed cases globally. The first cases in December were traced to a seafood market in the Chinese city of Wuhan, the heart of the epidemic from where Bangladesh evacuated 312 citizens and quarantined them in Dhaka on Feb 1. The government said the number of Bangladeshis who wanted to return but could not be brought back is 171. “We’ve spent much for those who want to return now, but still it’s not possible,” Momen said, citing that the pilots of the special Wuhan flight have been denied entry to other countries. After the evacuation, Cabinet Secretary Khandker Anwarul Islam had said a refusal by the crew to fly the plane is a big problem to bring back the 171 others. “If we can find a plane to charter, that will be the best option. And in that case Chinese planes will be the first preference,” the secretary had added. Most of the 312 Bangladeshi evacuees from China have been quarantined at the Ashkona Hajj Camp near the Dhaka airport. The rest of them have been hospitalised with symptoms similar to those of coronavirus infection. “China had agreed once as well. But they refused later. It’s a sensitive matter,” he said. “We can’t send any flight. No crew member agrees to go there either. So, we’ve told them [stranded Bangladeshis] to wait,” the minister said. Some of the Bangladesh nationals studying at the Three Gorges University in Yichang, some 285 kilometres from Wuhan, told bdnews24.com that a total of 172 Bangladeshi students have been stranded there. They complained of a shortage of food and drinking water due to the lockdown. Momen denied the allegations saying the Chinese authorities were sending food and water properly on time to the 23 places where the Bangladeshis stay.

Bangladesh screening Maitree Express passengers from India amid coronavirus scare,13 February 2020 02:31 AM,The Directorate General of Health Services is screening the passengers of Maitree Express train that runs on Dhaka-Kolkata route in a precautionary move amid a global outbreak of coronavirus.,"The train passengers from India are undergoing screening at Cantonment Railway Station in Dhaka from Tuesday after similar measures have been taken at airports, land ports and maritime ports, said Meerjady Sabrina Flora, the director of the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research in a press conference on Wednesday. Though the train crosses Benapole Station, no passenger gets down there. The Maitree Express runs between Dhaka and Kolkata five days a week. The train leaves Dhaka on Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday. It leaves Kolkata on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday and Saturday. The health workers did not find any coronavirus patient among the passengers who have undergone screening on return from China. Two Bangladeshis infected with the virus have been hospitalised in Singapore. One of them came in contact with 19 people who were also quarantined. As many as 10 of them were Bangladeshis, Flora said. The government of Singapore will pay for their treatment bill, she said. The new coronavirus since its outbreak in Wuhan, China has killed more than 1,100 people in the country where the number of total infected people has crossed 45,000. It will take 18 more months to get a vaccine for the new coronavirus officially called COVID-19, Tedros Adhanom, the director general of World Health Organization, said at a press conference in Geneva on Tuesday. Flora also noted that it would take quite some time to get the vaccine. Awareness, personal hygiene and discipline are the best ways to prevent the disease, she said. All the 312 Bangladeshis, who were quarantined at the Ashkona Hajj Camp after evacuation from Wuhan, were doing well, she said. They will be kept there until Feb 15. The procedure to release them from there has not been confirmed.","Maitree Express, Coronavirus screening"

The first cases in December were traced to a seafood market in the Chinese city of Wuhan, the heart of the epidemic from where Bangladesh evacuated 312 citizens and quarantined them in Dhaka on Feb 1. Li Jiming used the example of how a Japanese taxi driver transmitted the virus to those who came in contact with him to explain the risks involved in evacuating the Bangladeshi citizens from China.

A Bangladeshi in the United Arab Emirates has also been infected, as have Filipino and Indonesian domestic workers in Singapore and Hong Kong. In Singapore, construction workers from South Asia often live in 12-bed dormitories with shared bathrooms. Some of the high-profile virus clusters during the outbreak have involved people living close together, such as in prisons or aboard cruise ships. The virus, SARS-CoV-2, has killed more than 2,600 in China, where it first surfaced late last year. Kakon Miyan, a 24-year-old construction worker in Singapore, said a lot of his friends had returned to Bangladesh, where there have been no reported cases of the virus, and will only come back when the city-state appears clear. ""We're staying for now, but maybe if the situation worsens then we will go back too,"" he said, speaking in Bengali alongside a few colleagues.

""My income is crucial,"" said Haq, whose father, a farmer, does not earn enough to support his six-member family, several of whom are still in school.

They said they had also vomited and fainted. “I feel much better now after treatment,” Nipa Roy said. The government’s disease control agency IEDCR has warned against spreading rumours about the coronavirus, especially on social media. Rumours will jeopardise efforts to prevent an outbreak in Bangladesh, the IEDCR says. The authorities in Tangail forcefully hospitalised a returnee from Singapore on Feb 16 even though he did not show symptoms as fears of the coronavirus deepened following infections of five Bangladeshis in the city state. A woman in Satkhira died of a heart attack on Feb 11 reportedly after she panicked on rumours that her son had been diagnosed with the coronavirus.","Mass hysteria, Coronavirus rumours, Golden Timing, Evergreen Products BD"
IEDCR suggests home quarantine for returnees from countries with coronavirus cases,01 March 2020 04:26 PM,"The Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research has suggested people returning from countries having coronavirus infection cases to quarantine themselves at home even if they do not show any symptom.","The IEDCR made the call in an effort to avoid the spread of Covid-19 infections in Bangladesh as it spread in more than 50 countries. “No case of coronavirus infection has been identified in Bangladesh as of now. If the virus ever enters Bangladesh, it will be through the people travelling in those countries,” IEDCR Director Meerjady Sabrina Flora said at a media briefing in Dhaka on Sunday. “Therefore, the returnees must remain in a home quarantine for some days and should not come out unless it is badly needed,” she said. Bangladesh tested the blood samples of 88 people but did not find any case of infection. The IEDCR nevertheless asked people to remain cautious as the pathogen has spread quickly. “We suggest that those who return home from abroad should use masks for going home from the airport. If possible, they should use private transports. They should keep the windows open,” said Flora. “We earnestly request you to remain at home and avoid crowded areas. Use a mask if you have to go out.” The authorities are prepared to identify any infected person through screening and provide treatment at the airport, according to the IEDCR director. Flora suggested contacting the IEDCR via its hotline in case of anyone coming from abroad with symptoms. The IEDCR called for the Bangladeshi nationals to avoid the countries that reported coronavirus cases. Five Bangladeshi migrant workers were infected with the virus in Singapore: two have been discharged from the hospital and another two will be released soon, Flora said. The fifth is still in intensive care in the city state. Another Bangladeshi national was infected in the United Arab Emirates.",Bangladesh

Three sailors kept in ‘isolation’ in Mongla for coronavirus screening,05 March 2020 04:53 PM,Three sailors of a ship that reached the Mongla port have been taken into the isolation ward for having body temperature more than the normal range amid the global outbreak of the coronavirus.,"The authorities have stopped the offloading of goods from the Serenitas N, a bulk carrier sailing under the flag of the Marshal Islands, said Mongla Port’s harbour master Fakharuddin Ahmed. The Serenitas N sailed from the Lianyungang port in China to the Mongla port via Chattogram port carrying 24,000 tonnes of coal on Wednesday. A five-member medical team of the port entered the ship for medical check-ups of the sailors, said Samir Asif, a physician in the port hospital. Of the 20 sailors, three Filipinos were found with body temperature crossing the normal range. They were taken into the isolation ward for further medical screening. Though the sailors have high body temperature, they did not show other symptoms common to coronavirus patients, Asif told bdnews24.com.

Tripura government shuts down all border haats with Bangladesh over coronavirus,12 March 2020 05:49 PM,"The Tripura government has decided to shut down all the border haats (markets) with Bangladesh as part of the precautionary measures against novel coronavirus, reports The Telegraph.","A memorandum has been issued from the health and family welfare department on Wednesday saying that mass gatherings in any form may be avoided or possibly be postponed till the outbreak of the disease is contained. “All citizens are requested to restrict mass gatherings to avoid severe acute respiratory illness or SAR case and influenza-like illness, including Covid-19. In case a gathering cannot be avoided, the organiser should ensure precautionary material, according to the directives sent out to all concerned. This restriction may continue until further orders,” the memo said.

Moreover, all border haats may be closed for the time being in consultation with Bangladesh authorities,” the memo read. Tripura has two functional border haats with Bangladesh at Kamalasagar in Sepahijala district and Srinagar in South Tripura, according to the report. Three more border haats are also in the pipeline. The department also directed all district officials to take an initiative for regular sanitisation and awareness generation drives at all bus/truck terminus, shopping malls and cinema halls.

Govt tightens quarantine requirement for overseas returnees,17 March 2020 02:23 AM,The government is stepping up its efforts to limit the spread of the novel coronavirus by promising to clamp down on people returning from abroad who fail to self-isolate after the number of confirmed cases in the country rose to eight.,"The cabinet decided to impose a mandatory 14-day quarantine on all travellers arriving in Bangladesh from overseas. The government’s disease control agency, the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR), has warned that anyone disobeying the requirement will face stringent measures, including fines. Foreign Minister AK Abdul Momen reiterated the government's stance after foreign diplomats raised concerns over reports of overseas returnees roaming freely in the country. Home Minister Asaduzzaman Khan Kamal also warned of action from law-enforcement against those who disobey the quarantine requirement. The Directorate General of Health Services has issued several directives on 'home quarantine' aimed at returnees from abroad. More than 100 Bangladeshis were evacuated from the Chinese of Wuhan, the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak, and were kept in quarantine at Dhaka's Ashkona Hajj Camp in January. They were released after 14 days as their tests for the virus returned negative results. The virus has since spread to over 118 countries around the world with Europe becoming its current epicentre. It has infected more than 162,000 people and killed over 6,000 globally. In the meantime, the country confirmed its first cases of the coronavirus after three people -- two of whom had returned from Italy -- tested positive for the infection. The number of cases went up to eight on Monday, among whom, three are relatives of a Bangladeshi expatriate from Italy. Nearly 300 Bangladeshis returned from Italy, the worst-affected country in Europe, between Saturday and Sunday. But most of them refused to be placed in institutional quarantine while there were also reports that many others who came back earlier had been out and about, prompting the strict measures from the cabinet. Speaking after the cabinet meeting chaired by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina on Monday, Cabinet Secretary Khandker Anwarul Islam said, ""Whoever returns from abroad, be it from a government programme, training or ordinary people, will have to undergo a mandatory 14-day quarantine without exception."" Anyone failing to comply with the order will face action under the Infectious Diseases (Prevention, Control And Elimination) Act, warned Anwarul. The law prescribes up to three months in jail and a fine of up to Tk 50,000 for anyone who obstructs the government's efforts to control an infectious disease or disobeys an order. The cabinet secretary highlighted a Tk 10,000 fine imposed on a returnee from Saudi Arabia in Mankikganj and said, ""Rangpur's divisional commissioner returned to the country on Monday. He has been told that he has to quarantine himself for 14 days. IEDCR Director Meerjady Sabrina Flora said district-level committees have been directed to be uncompromising on the enforcement of the mandatory quarantine. According to the IEDCR, more than 606,012 people have come back to Bangladesh from abroad until Mar 15, with 9,965 returning in the 24 hours to Monday noon. Apart from the three international airports, many have entered the country through land and sea ports. It has come to the IEDCR's attention that many returnees from abroad have taken part in social gatherings, said Flora. The IEDCR stressed the need to raise awareness about the risks among family members of returnees and warned that an outbreak would be hard to prevent if self-isolation is not ensured. ""Once again we are requesting those who returned from abroad to distance themselves from their family members. We will be able to isolate them from society through the steps that we're taking. If they cannot be isolated from family members then it will be difficult to prevent an outbreak. In that case, we'll have to enforce institutional quarantines.""",Bangladesh

The first had been an initial alert level when no coronavirus case had been reported, which Bangladesh has already passed. The authorities would switch to the second level when the first cases came from abroad. The next phase would be in place if the number of coronavirus cases increases, Flora had said. The government closed the door to travellers from the European countries, except Britain, for two weeks from Monday after Europe was declared the epicentre of the pandemic. Returnees from foreign countries have been ordered to go into mandatory home quarantine for 14 days, the incubation period of the virus. Several people have been punished for breaking quarantine rules as the government is going tough to keep the returnees away from others. Schools, colleges and all other educational institutions have been shut until Mar 31.

Since the restrictions were ramped up on March 12, the number of cases has more than doubled to 31,506 and the death toll more than tripled to 2,503. France has put its 67 million people under lockdown and says it is ready to nationalise big companies suffering financial turmoil while Spain has announced a 200 billion euro package to help companies and protect workers and other vulnerable groups. Britain launched a new lending scheme to provide short-term bridging finance for large businesses. Mainland China had 13 new cases on Tuesday, down from 21 a day earlier.

"No food shortage, so don’t stock up for coronavirus threat: Hasina",21 March 2020 04:57 PM,Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has assured that Bangladesh has enough food stock and is able to import a year worth of food for the whole nation.,"Hasina has called for stopping food stocking which is leading to a ‘crisis’ in the market amid fears of a novel coronavirus outbreak. After a death from the coronavirus and cancellations of public gatherings, panic has set in and spread to the markets of Bangladesh. In fear, many have resorted to purchasing a month’s worth of food products causing a crisis in the market which in turn resulted in the price hikes of different staple foods, including rice. “I see some people buying stuffs and taking them home to stock. I saw a person buy 30kg of salt. I don’t know what he will do with 30kg of salt,” Hasina said after casting her vote in the by-poll to the Dhaka-10 parliamentary seats at Dhaka City College on Saturday. “The price of onions went up once, due to which many bought huge amounts of onions to stock. The result was that those onions rotted and were thrown away.” She called for easing pressure on the market and said, “Please don’t panic and gather according to your needs.” “We have 1.7 million tonnes of food in government stock. We have 350,000 tonnes of wheat in stock. In addition, non-government rice mills have a lot in stock and we also have crops in fields. “We can buy food worth a year with the kind of reserve that we have. So there should be no worries.” Saying that the government is keeping an eye out to keep the market stable, Hasina called for the public to stay aware and conscious.","Novel Coronavirus, PM, Sheikh Hasina, by-poll"

"Two US returnees, who attended wedding reception in Bangladesh, test positive for coronavirus",22 March 2020 08:03 PM,Panic has gripped Gaibandha after two returnees from the US have tested positive for coronavirus after attending a wedding reception in Sadullapur Upazila.,"The Sadullapur Upazila Coronavirus Prevention Committee recommended locking the Upazila down to prevent further spread of the virus as hundreds of people who joined the reception voted in Saturday’s parliamentary by-election. But the committee’s chief Gaibandha Deputy Commissioner Abdul Matin has ignored the recommendation. The panel made the recommendation at an emergency meeting on Sunday after the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research or IEDCR confirmed that the two patients were infected with the virus. Shahinoor Islam, the Upazila health and family planning officer, said a woman of the family that hosted the reception was quarantined after falling ill. Shahinoor, who is also member secretary of the coronavirus prevention panel, said two relatives of the family had recently returned to their home in Gaibandha town from the US. The two came to the home in Sadullapur on Mar 11 to attend the ceremony and went back to their house after two more days. The district health authorities ordered home quarantine for them later when it came to know about the issue, Shahinoor said. Specimens from their bodies were sent to the IEDCR lab in Dhaka for coronavirus test when they fell ill. As the tests came back positive, the coronavirus prevention committee decided to lock the entire Upazila down. In a letter requesting the DC’s permission for the lockdown, the committee wrote that 400 to 500 people had attended the wedding reception. Many of those who had joined the reception visited polling stations in the by-election to Gaibandha-3 seat consisting of Sadullapur and Palashbari Upazilas on Saturday, according to the letter. The turnout in the constituency with over 435,000 voters was around 60 percent, according to the Election Commission, which defied calls to postpone the polls over coronavirus. DC Matin said he received the letter but the situation “does not warrant lockdown”. It
could not be confirmed whether the two patients in Gaibandha were among the total

The resident of North Tolarbagh was the secretary of the Darul Ihsan Jame Mosque’s governing body in the neighbourhood, said Shubhashish Biswas, president of the local building owners’ association. The person who died on Sunday was a neighbour and close to the one who passes away on Saturday, Biswas said. The second man had fever and respiratory problem for two to three days and was taken to the Kurmitola General Hospital, where the coronavirus patients or suspected cases are kept in isolation, Biswas said. The IEDCR took specimens from his body for coronavirus test later.

They only did it under pressure from the health ministry after we contacted it,” he told bdnews24.com. In a Facebook post, he described “a son’s failure to save his father from death”. He said no hospital was agreeing to admit his father after learning about the symptoms. The Delta Hospital in Mirpur admitted him finally, but did not treat him properly after receiving the confirmation on his diagnosis from the IEDCR, the son alleged. He also alleged some media outlets and Facebook users wrongly reported that his father came into contact with their relatives who live abroad. He said her elder sister and her husband live in Chattogram and the couple were under home quarantine in Tolarbagh after they came to visit the father on Mar 19. The husband of his younger sister lives in Japan and he has not come to Bangladesh for a year, the man said. He also said his younger brother and chauffeur had felt ill but tested negative for coronavirus.","Corona, Tolarbagh, Mirpur, Delta Hospital, COVID-19, coronavirus, mosque"
