Bangladesh to screen travellers from China at airports for deadly coronavirus,21 January 2020 02:49 AM,The authorities have put the airports on alert to prevent deadly coronavirus from spreading in Bangladesh by screening travellers from China where the number of patients has more than tripled in days and a third person has died.,"The Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research or IEDCR has in a letter asked the Civil Aviation Authority of Bangladesh to act to avoid the possible risk related to the Chinese virus, Meerjady Sabrina Flora, a director at the institute, told bdnews24.com on Monday. The government’s disease wing has also trained health workers at the airports for detection of patients with symptoms of coronavirus infection, which include fever, coughing and difficulty with breathing, she said. “We are closely monitoring the matter…We are alert and prepared,” she added. The measures to prevent a possible spread of the virus include screening travellers from China by using thermal scanner to detect fever, according to Flora. The travellers from China will be given health cards and asked to contact the IEDCR if they have fever within 14 days from arrival. The IEDCR has also alerted the three airlines that operate direct flights from China. Those ferrying passengers from China via other countries have also been contacted, Flora said. The travellers from China will have to fill in the health cards with certain information, AHM Touhid-ul Ahsan, a director at Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport in Dhaka, said. If any traveller is found with temperature higher than 100 degrees Fahrenheit, he or she will be kept in an observation room at the airport, according to Ahsan. The traveller will be shifted to the Kurmitola General Hospital if necessary, he said. The airport authorities were also displaying symptoms of coronavirus infection on digital boards to raise awareness, Ahsan added.

Thailand confirmed two cases of coronavirus from China the previous week. Reuters  Four patients have also been detected outside China after travelling from the country. The virus belongs to the same family of coronaviruses as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS, which killed nearly 800 people globally during a 2002-03 outbreak that had also emerged in China. The World Health Organisation said on Monday ""an animal source"" appeared most likely to be the primary source of the outbreak and that some ""limited human-to-human transmission"" occurred between close contacts. WHO later convened an emergency committee for Wednesday to assess whether the outbreak constitutes an international health emergency and what measures should be taken to manage it, Reuters reported. So far, the global health body has not recommended trade or travel restrictions, but a panel of independent experts could do so or make other recommendations to limit spread. Authorities around the globe, including in the United States and many Asian countries, have stepped up screening of travellers from Wuhan, the central city where the virus was first discovered."
Bangladesh must stay fully alert to coronavirus: expert,25 January 2020 11:51 PM,"Bangladesh must stay alert and do whatever it takes to prevent the spread of coronavirus from China, an expert has said.","Like many other countries, Bangladesh is highly connected
to China for trade and other reasons. “We must be on maximum alert. And the people should take
it seriously. It’s a matter that cannot be neglected. We must prepare ourselves
assuming that the virus is going to hit Bangladesh within a month,” said
Mushtuq Husain, a former chief scientific officer at the government’s disease
control centre. But Meerjady Sabrina Flora, a director at the Institute
of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research or IEDCR, said Bangladesh has no
reason to panic. “But it’s necessary to stay prepared. Different countries
have reported coronavirus cases,” she said, adding that the authorities in
local hospitals were preparing separate wards so that any infected patient can
be quarantined immediately after detection. With more than 1,400 people infected worldwide, mostly in
China, Hong Kong declared a virus emergency, scrapped celebrations and
restricted links to mainland China. Australia confirmed its first four cases on Saturday,
Malaysia confirmed three and France reported Europe's first cases on Friday, as
health authorities around the world scrambled to prevent a pandemic. The United States is arranging a charter flight on Sunday
to bring its citizens and diplomats back from Wuhan, the central Chinese city
that is the epicentre of the outbreak, the Wall Street Journal reported. The death toll in China has risen to 41, authorities
reported on Saturday, from 26 a day earlier. As of 6pm local time (1000 GMT),
1,372 people in China have been infected with the virus traced to a seafood
market in Wuhan that was illegally selling wildlife. The virus has also been detected in Thailand, Vietnam,
Singapore, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Nepal, Pakistan and the United States.

REUTERS  Nine people, mostly travellers from China, came to the
IEDCR to report the suspicion of coronavirus infection but none was found
infected, she said. Husain, however, thinks screening travellers at airports
is not enough because some countries reported coronavirus cases even weeks
after the infected people’s arrival from China without any symptom. “A coronavirus patient can get fever anytime within 14 days from infection. The
travellers from China must report to the IEDCR if they have a fever a few days
after arrival,” he said. Husain also said patients with other diseases should
maintain extra cleanliness. The deaths were reported in cases where the
infected people were suffering from other diseases, he said. The Bangladesh embassy in China was “in touch” with about
400 Bangladeshi students, who have been locked down along with millions in
Wuhan, the foreign ministry said. The embassy also established contact with the Chinese
authorities to ensure urgent support for the expatriates in Wuhan, the ministry
said in a statement. “As of today, no news of any infection or death caused by
coronavirus to any foreigners is reported.” The embassy has opened a hotline number: +86
178-0111-6005."
Experts say Bangladesh risks coronavirus outbreak even as no case reported yet,26 January 2020 11:07 PM,"The authorities have tested over 2,000 travellers from China and no one has been found infected with coronavirus but experts believe Bangladesh still risks an outbreak.","South Asian neighbours Pakistan and Nepal have confirmed coronavirus cases while India has kept over 100 people under observation following screening for a possible exposure to novel coronavirus, or nCoV. Like other countries across the globe, Bangladesh has been screening travellers from China at airports since Jan 21. Travellers at land ports and seaports are also being screened, Health Minister Zahid Maleque told bdnews24.com on Sunday. “We’ve strengthened workforce at these ports. We’ll be able to detect any coronavirus infection,” he added. At Dhaka’s Shahjalal International Airport, Health Officer Md Shahriar Sazzad said they screened a total of 2,190 passengers from China until Sunday. He said the authorities found no one with the symptoms of coronavirus infection that can cause pneumonia, which has been deadly in some cases. The symptoms include fever, coughing and difficulty with breathing. The three airlines that carry passengers directly from China to Dhaka are China Eastern, China Southern, and US-Bangla Airlines. Dragon Airlines operates flights from Hong Kong, where calls have grown to shut the borders with mainland China to minimise the risk of coronavirus infection.

REUTERS  The virus, believed to have originated late last year in a seafood market in the central Chinese city of Wuhan that was illegally selling wildlife, has spread to cities including Beijing and Shanghai. The ability of the new coronavirus to spread is strengthening and infections could continue to rise, China's National Health Commission said on Sunday, according to Reuters. Nearly 2,000 people in China have been infected and 56 killed by the disease. China's National Health Commission Minister Ma Xiaowei said the incubation period for the virus can range from one to 14 days, and the virus is infectious during incubation, which was not the case with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), the news agency reported. SARS was a coronavirus that originated in China and killed nearly 800 people globally in 2002 and 2003. Bangladesh had reported Middle-East Acute Respiratory Syndrome or MERS, another strain of coronavirus, in a traveller from Abu Dhabi during a 2012 outbreak, believed to have originated from camels.

REUTERS  Without symptoms, a person may not know they have the infection, but still be able to spread it, the BBC reported, citing Chinese officials. Dense population has made Bangladesh vulnerable to an outbreak of the new virus if any infected person or animal enters the country, believes Kabirul Bashar, who teaches zoology at the Jahangirngar University. “Animals don’t have borders. No one will be able to stop an infected animal from crossing the border with India. Now the date juice season is under way. The virus can transmit through bats drinking date juice,” he said. “Besides these, people in our country don’t maintain necessary personal and civic hygiene. They spit at random on the streets,” he added. Professor ABM Abdullah, a former dean of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University’s medicine department, said prevention “is very much necessary” as there is no vaccine or specific treatment for the new virus."
Govt to bring back Bangladeshis from China amid coronavirus outbreak,27 January 2020 02:30 PM,"The government plans to bring back Bangladeshis, if willing, from China amid coronavirus outbreak, State Minister for Foreign Affairs Shahriar Alam said in a Facebook post on Monday.","“Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has ordered arrangements for the return of Bangladeshi nationals, if willing, from China.” Talks have been initiated with the Chinese government regarding the matter, he said, adding the process will depend on the local administration’s consent.A preliminary directive will be issued on Monday to list those interested in returning home from China, the Alam said. There are about 400 Bangladeshi students in Wuhan, the epicentre of coronavirus outbreak, Bangladesh's foreign ministry said in a statement on Saturday. However, no person living in Bangladesh has been infected with the virus yet. In the wake of the outbreak, the Bangladesh Embassy in Beijing has launched a hotline to address any urgent need. Students and researchers can dial +86 178-0111-6005 to receive 24/7 assistance. The virus has spread to Thailand, Vietnam, Taiwan, South Korea, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, Nepal, the US, France, Australia and Canada over the past few days. As of Jan 27, the virus has killed 81 people in China and infected more than 2,750 globally, according to Reuters."
Hasina puts Bangladesh on alert as coronavirus fears intensify,27 January 2020 08:10 PM,Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has ordered government officials to stay fully alert to the threat of a novel coronavirus that has killed 81 people in China in a bid to prevent it from spreading to Bangladesh.,"She gave the directive at a cabinet meeting at the Secretariat on Monday, said Cabinet Secretary Khandker Anwarul Islam. “The prime minister said we must be more alert and attentive to the threat. We must thoroughly screen passengers coming into the country from China,” he said. “Everyone must be careful. We need to set up special quarantine measures in airports and ports so that it doesn’t spread in Bangladesh.” The authorities have been instructed to keep an eye on passengers arriving in the country from China or Hong Kong, according to Anwarul. Ports receiving goods directly from China will also be under the scanner.    As worries grew around the world, Chinese-ruled Hong Kong, which has had eight confirmed cases, banned entry to people who had visited Hubei in the past 14 days. The ban did not cover Hong Kong residents. The number of deaths from the flu-like virus in Hubei climbed to 76 from 56, health officials said, with five deaths elsewhere in China, including the southern island province of Hainan, which reported its first fatality on Monday. While a small number of cases have been confirmed in more than 10 countries, linked to people who travelled from Wuhan, no deaths have been reported elsewhere."
Coronavirus panic spreads as 2 of a family die from fever in Munshiganj,27 January 2020 09:45 PM,"A woman and her nephew have died from fever within 16 hours of each other in Munshiganj's Louhajang Upazila, sparking fears of an outbreak of a novel coronavirus which originated in China.","But health officials have preliminarily ruled out the deadly virus as the cause of their deaths, according to the district's Civil Surgeon Dr Abul Kalam Azam. A probe panel has been formed to look into the matter. It came after Mir Abdur Rahman, a 3-year-old boy from the Upazila's Jasaldia village, died an hour after being struck by a fever in the early hours of Monday. His aunt Shamima Begum, 34, died in similar at 8 am on Sunday. According to Shamima's brother-in-law Mir Shiblu, she had been feeling feverish on the morning of her death. The fever gradually intensified and blood clots began appearing on different parts of her body before she died. Abdur began showing the same symptoms shortly after contracting a fever at night, said Shiblu. Although Shamima had been buried without an autopsy, the family took Abdur to the Upazila Health Complex for a check-up. Later, a medical team and officials from the local administration along with a representative of the World Health Organisation visited the village for an inspection on Monday. After the outbreak of the coronavirus in China's Wuhan, authorities have stepped up precautionary measures at airports in Bangladesh with travellers from China being screened on arrival, said Civil Surgeon Abul. Bangladesh is yet to confirm any case of the virus. ""None of their family members have gone or returned from abroad in the last 14 days. Therefore, the initial belief is that their deaths were not caused by the coronavirus. Besides, their deaths can't be attributed to the Nipah virus either as no one in the family consumed any date juice recently."" The total number of confirmed cases of the virus in China has risen to 2,744, about half of them in Hubei province, whose capital is Wuhan – the epicentre of the outbreak. As worries grew around the world, Chinese-ruled Hong Kong, which has had eight confirmed cases, banned entry to people who had visited Hubei in the past 14 days. The ban did not cover Hong Kong residents. The number of deaths from the flu-like virus in Hubei climbed to 76 from 56, health officials said, with five deaths elsewhere in China, including the southern island province of Hainan, which reported its first fatality on Monday. While a small number of cases have been confirmed in more than 10 countries, linked to people who travelled from Wuhan, no deaths have been reported elsewhere."
"Chinese national hospitalised in Dhaka with cold, fever amid coronavirus scare",27 January 2020 10:44 PM,A Chinese national has been hospitalised with a cold and fever in Dhaka amid growing fears over an outbreak of a novel coronavirus which has originated in China.,"The health directorate has decided to run tests on him as a precaution after confirming the development on Monday. Since its outbreak in Wuhan, the death toll from the virus in China has risen to 81, prompting countries around the world to step up preventative measures. Airports in Bangladesh have also installed thermal scanners alongside other screening measures for travellers from China in a bid to prevent the virus from spreading. According to health experts, the symptoms of the coronavirus virus infection -- which can cause pneumonia in some cases -- include fever, coughing and difficulty with breathing.    Aside from undergoing thermal screenings for fever, travellers from China are also being given health cards and asked to contact the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research or IEDCR if they have fever within 14 days from arrival. But as on Sunday, the IEDCR did not detect the presence of the virus in any of the over 2,000 people they have tested. Meerjady Sabrina Flora, a director at the IEDCR, however, would not be drawn to comment on the hospitalisation of the Chinese national. ""The hospital has informed us of the matter. If we believe that it is necessary to run tests on the sample then we will do so."" The total number of confirmed cases of the virus in China has risen to 2,744, about half of them in Hubei province, whose capital is Wuhan – the epicentre of the outbreak. While a small number of cases have been confirmed in more than 10 countries, linked to people who travelled from Wuhan, no deaths have been reported elsewhere. Bangladesh is yet to confirm any case of the virus."
Bangladesh not sending experts to China amid coronavirus outbreak,29 January 2020 12:46 AM,"The government has no interest in sending any expert to China to study the coronavirus outbreak, the health minister has said.","Zahid Maleque was discussing the government’s preparations to tackle the situation with reporters at the Secretariat in Dhaka on Tuesday as the new virus claimed more than 100 lives in China in around three weeks. As the flu-like virus has spread to many countries, the authorities in Bangladesh are screening passengers from China at airports to stop the spread of the disease. A reporter asked whether the government was planning to send anyone to China to learn how the country was dealing with the outbreak after an inter-ministerial meeting on awareness and efforts on the contagious virus. Most of the media workers and those attending the meeting broke into laughter at the time as the government is often criticised for spending millions of takas to send officials abroad so that they can gain practical experience. “We don’t feel the need for sending any team of experts at this moment. We will consider it in future if necessary,” came the health minister’s response. Government officials or public university teachers’ foreign tours have made headlines a number of times as they have travelled abroad spending millions of takas from the national exchequer for reasons like mastering the skills of digging pond, or purchasing things like elevators or increasing project capabilities."
Two weeks of home quarantine on return from abroad advised to stop coronavirus spread,29 January 2020 03:13 AM,A doctor has advised those returning from abroad to remain isolated at their homes for two weeks from the date of arrival to stop the spread of novel coronavirus as at least a dozen countries have reported patients with over 100 deaths in China.,"The Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University or BSMMU in Dhaka organised a seminar on the new virus on Tuesday. Dr Md Nazmul Ahsan, who presented a paper on prevention and cure of coronavirus, said people should wash hands regularly with soap and use masks. While sneezing or coughing, they should cover their face. The doctor said no one should be in close contact with any coronavirus patient or suspected case as the disease is now believed to have the ability of human-to-human transmission. “And if someone comes from abroad, they should not go outside unless absolutely necessary for two weeks. They must visit a doctor if they detect the symptoms of the disease,” he said, referring to the 14-day incubation period of the new virus. The symptoms of the coronavirus infection include fever, cold, sneezing, coughing, body ache, weakness and looseness, according to Dr Shamim Ahmed of chest diseases department. The doctor said there was no treatment for coronavirus, but the patients can take paracetamol and must eat fluid-based nutritious food. Vice-Chancellor Dr Kanak Kanti Barua warned that the disease may still spread and cause a disaster in densely populated Bangladesh though no coronavirus has been confirmed yet."
DGHS orders list of all China returnees in last 14 days amid virus fears,30 January 2020 10:46 AM,The Directorate General of Health Services has directed local authorities to draw up a list of all returnees from China in the last 14 days amid the outbreak of a fatal coronavirus.,"Deputy commissioners, police superintendents and civil surgeons have been asked to prepare the list in their respective districts, the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research or IEDCR said in a statement on Wednesday. The decision was taken at a meeting of the DGHS headed by its Director General Prof Abul Kalam Azad on Tuesday, the statement said.    The authority also briefed the Association of Travel Agents of Bangladesh and  Federation of Bangladesh Chamber of Commerce on travel to China. Airport authorities have not identify any case of the virus in Bangladesh after screening 3,348 passengers as of Wednesday, according to the IEDCR statement said. The IEDCR received 53 calls on its hotline as of now – nine of which were related to the coronavirus. No case of the coronavirus infection has been diagnosed so far."
"Bangladeshi returnee from China hospitalised in Dhaka with cold, fever amid coronavirus scare",30 January 2020 05:52 PM,The authorities have admitted a Bangladeshi national with fever and cold to a hospital in Dhaka on return from China where the death toll from the coronavirus which shows similar symptoms has risen to 170.,"“We are not saying that he is infected with coronavirus.

The authorities collected blood sample from the patient and he will be kept at the “isolation unit” until all necessary tests are done, Azad said. “His body temperature has decreased. There is nothing to be afraid,” he added. The Bangladeshi patient arrived in Dhaka from Guangzhou, according to Azad. The authorities are screening travellers from China at the airports to stop the spread of the deadly virus.    The patient arrived at Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport on a flight at about 11pm on Wednesday night, Shahriar Sazzad, a doctor at the airport’s health centre, told bdnews24.com. “He was cleared by the authorities in China. But we collected samples and kept him at an isolated unit of a hospital when his high body temperature arose our suspicion,” he added. He identified the patient as a software engineer in his 30s. Two Ansar members wearing masks were seen guarding the isolated unit at one of the hospitals. No one at the hospital agreed to speak about the patient."
"‘Get us out of here’, plead foreign students at China virus epicentre",30 January 2020 11:30 PM,"Foreign students stuck in the Chinese city of Wuhan, the epicentre of a coronavirus outbreak, are launching social media campaigns, making phone calls and writing letters urging their governments to get them out as soon as possible.","Governments globally are grappling with the challenge of how to get their citizens out of China's Hubei province, where 60 million residents now live under virtual lockdown. Pakistan said that quarantine regulations prevented it from flying out the more than 500 Pakistani students and their families from Wuhan. Bangladesh and India said they were putting aircraft on standby. Muhammad Rauf, 30, a Pakistani master's student, told Reuters he and around 40 others were locked in their Wuhan dormitory for all but four hours a day. ""How long will the lockdown be?... What will we do? Just count down our days?"" he said, adding they had been calling for an evacuation plan from their government for ten days.

""They say that we cannot evacuate. Why can't they evacuate us? Other countries have evacuated,"" he said. ""We are thankful to the Chinese government ... but we are not the responsibility of the Chinese government. We are the responsibility of our government."" The United States airlifted nearly 200 Americans from Wuhan on Wednesday and South Korea on Thursday was preparing up to four evacuation flights. In one video posted on social media, a group of Pakistani students who said they were in Wuhan chanted ""please save us"" while one man asked the government to ""take some measures to get us out of here"". China has become a major destination for South Asian university students in recent years, fuelled in part by scholarships offered as China expands its influence in the region through President Xi Jinping's flagship Belt and Road infrastructure programme. Pakistan and China are very close allies. More than 400 Bangladeshis, mostly students, are stranded in Wuhan. ""Wuhan has become a ghost town,"" Rakibil Hafiz, a Bangladeshi engineering student at Hubei University of Technology, told Reuters via WhatsApp. ""There is nothing we can do. We are all stuck in the dormitory. We are very worried. I want to go home."""

The Chinese national was hospitalised on Monday with cold and fever amid the coronavirus scare some days after returning from his homeland. The Bangladeshi was admitted to the hospital from the airport on detection of high body temperature on Tuesday night."

How do bats live with so many viruses?,01 February 2020 04:18 AM,"If previous outbreaks of coronavirus are any indication, the Wuhan strain that is now spreading may eventually be traced back to bats.","Dr Peter Daszak, president of EcoHealth Alliance, who has been working in China for 15 years studying diseases that jump from animals to people, said, “We don’t know the source yet, but there’s pretty strong evidence that this is a bat origin coronavirus.” He said, “It’s probably going to be the Chinese horseshoe bat,” a common species that weighs up to 1 ounce. If he’s right, this strain will join many other viruses that bats carry. SARS and MERS epidemics were caused by bat coronaviruses, as was a highly destructive viral epidemic in pigs. One bat can host many different viruses without getting sick. They are the natural reservoir for the Marburg virus, and Nipah and Hendra viruses, which have caused human disease and outbreaks in Africa, Malaysia, Bangladesh and Australia. They are thought to be the natural reservoir for the Ebola virus. They also carry the rabies virus, but in that case the bats are affected by the disease. Their tolerance of viruses, which surpasses that of other mammals, is one of their many distinctive qualities. They are the only flying mammals, they devour disease-carrying insects by the ton, and they are essential in the pollination of many fruits, like bananas, avocados and mangoes. They are also an incredibly diverse group, making up about a quarter of all mammalian species. But their ability to coexist with viruses that can spill over to other animals, in particular humans, can have devastating consequences when we eat them, trade them in livestock markets and invade their territory. Learning how they carry and survive so many viruses has been a deep question for science, and new research suggests that the answer may be how the bats’ evolutionary adaptations to flight changed their immune systems. In a 2018 paper in Cell Host and Microbe, scientists in China and Singapore reported their investigation of how bats handle something called DNA sensing. The energy demands of flight are so great that cells in the body break down and release bits of DNA that are then floating around where they shouldn’t be. Mammals, including bats, have ways to identify and respond to such bits of DNA, which might indicate an invasion of a disease-causing organism. But in bats, they found, evolution has weakened that system, which would normally cause inflammation as it fought the viruses. Bats have lost some genes involved in that response, which makes sense because the inflammation itself can be very damaging to the body. They have a weakened response, but it is still there. Thus, the researchers write, this weakened response may allow them to maintain a “balanced state of ‘effective response but not ‘over response’ against viruses.” How to manage and contain the current outbreak of the virus officially known as nCoV-2019, is, of course, of paramount importance now. But tracing its origin and taking action to combat further outbreaks may depend partly on knowledge and monitoring of bats. “The outbreak can be contained and controlled,” Daszak said. “But if we don’t know the origin in the long term then this virus can continue to spill over.” Scientists in China were already studying the bats carefully, well aware that an outbreak like the current one would most likely happen. In the spring, in an article on bat coronaviruses, or CoVs, a group of Chinese researchers wrote that “it is generally believed that batborne CoVs will re-emerge to cause the next disease outbreak.” They added, “In this regard, China is a likely hot spot.” This wasn’t clairvoyance, but conventional wisdom. Certainly rodents, primates and birds also carry diseases that can and have jumped to people; bats are far from alone in that regard. But there are reasons they have been implicated in several disease outbreaks and are likely to be implicated in more. They are numerous and widespread. While bats account for a quarter of mammalian species, rodents are 50%, and then there’s the rest of us. Bats live on every continent except Antarctica, in proximity to humans and farms. The ability to fly makes them wide-ranging, which helps in spreading viruses, and their faeces can spread disease. People in many parts of the world eat bats and sell them in live animal markets, which was the source of SARS and possibly the latest coronavirus outbreak that began in Wuhan. They also often live in huge colonies in caves, where crowded conditions are ideal for passing viruses to one another. In a 2017 report in Nature, Daszak, Kevin J Olival and other colleagues from EcoHealth Alliance reported that they had created a database of 754 mammal species and 586 viral species, and analysed which viruses were harboured by which mammals and how they affected their hosts. They confirmed what scientists had thought: “Bats are host to a significantly higher proportion of zoonoses than all other mammalian orders.” Zoonoses are diseases that spill over from animals to humans. And they don’t just survive the viruses they harbour. Bats are remarkably long-lived for small mammals. The big brown bat, a common species in the United States, can live nearly 20 years in the wild. Others live closer to 40. One tiny bat in Siberia lived at least 41 years. Animals like house mice live about two years on average. While the bats must be studied, their physiology understood, and the viruses they harbour monitored for the sake of public health, that does not mean that the bats are to blame for the outbreak. As others have pointed out, humans have encroached on the lives of bats, not vice versa. Daszak stressed that stopping the sale of wildlife in markets is essential to curtail future outbreaks. But since such outbreaks are inevitable, Daszak says, monitoring and studying wildlife, like bats, is equally important. He compared the situation to terrorism. Both terrorist attacks and disease outbreaks seem inevitable. To get a jump on them, he said, intelligence is vital.  ©2020 The New York Times Company"
Bangladeshi nationals flying home from Wuhan amid coronavirus outbreak,01 February 2020 10:43 AM,"Over 300 Bangladeshi nationals are on their way back home onboard a special flight from the Chinese city of Wuhan, the locked down epicentre of a deadly coronavirus outbreak that has claimed more than 200 lives in the country.","The rescue flight of Biman Bangladesh took off at 7.45 am Dhaka time on Saturday from Wuhan Tianhe International Airport. Earlier on Friday, the authorities began moving the Bangladeshi students by bus to the airport where they underwent tests before boarding the plane. Biman's DGM for public relations Tahera Khondoker said a total of 316 passengers, including 15 children, are flying back to Dhaka. The flight is also carrying four doctors, four cockpit and 11 cabin crew. But Dr Reza Sultanuzzaman, a Bangladeshi researcher in China, who was involved in making the list of returnees, said two people did not travel with the rest due to problems with their paperwork. The passengers went through temperature and health screening more than once as they waited in the airport, said Dr Reza. The number of deaths from a coronavirus epidemic in China rose by 46 to 259 on Friday, the country's health authority said, as the United States announced new border curbs on foreign nationals who have been in China.    Amid fears that the virus could spread further overseas, the United States announced measures to restrict entry to foreign nationals who have recently been in China. All three major US airlines also said on Friday they would cancel flights to mainland China. Cities across China continue to implement special measures aimed at curbing the spread of the pathogen. Tianjin, a city in northern China with around 15 million people, said all schools and businesses would be suspended until further notice. The US-based China Human Rights Defenders urged the Chinese government to ease restrictions on movement and counter discrimination against residents of Wuhan and Hubei, adding that censorship had contributed to the spread of the virus.

Seven Bangladeshis hospitalised with fever on arrival from Wuhan amid coronavirus outbreak,01 February 2020 01:34 PM,"The authorities have put in hospitals in Dhaka eight of the 312 Bangladeshis evacuated from the Chinese city of Wuhan, the locked down epicentre of a deadly coronavirus outbreak that has sparked a global health emergency.","A special flight of Biman Bangladesh Airlines ferrying the evacuees arrived at Shahjalal International Airport sometime after 11:50am on Saturday, said Tahera Khandaker, a spokeswoman for the flag carrier.   The eight passengers were sent to two hospitals after health workers detected fever, Shahriar Sazzad, a health officer at the Dhaka airport, said. The rest of the evacuees were taken to the Ashkona Hajj Camp, where they will be quarantined for 14 days, the incubation period of the new virus.    Police and army personnel have been deployed to secure the camp. Health Minister Zahid Maleque had earlier urged the families to wait for sometime to see their loved ones.    Initially, 361 Bangladeshis had registered to return from Wuhan but 316 reported at Tianhe International Airport and four of them were barred as their body temperature was high, Azad said. The coronavirus epidemic has killed 259 people, all in China, until Saturday, according to the country's National Health Commission.    Additionally, 137 cases have been reported in other countries and regions. Infections have been reported in Australia, Britain, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, Russia, Spain, Thailand, the United States and 14 other countries and regions outside mainland China. No deaths have been reported outside China."
Condition of Bangladesh quarantine camp for Wuhan returnees raises fears of infection,02 February 2020 06:30 AM,The Bangladeshis evacuated from coronavirus-hit city of China were relieved when they landed in Dhaka with many flashing the victory sign from the airtight buses but their delight soon turned into fear of infection that they had thought was over.,"They are spending the nights on mattresses on the floors of the Ashkona Hajj Camp - a facility used to keep pilgrims before departure but now to quarantine the returnees from Wuhan – near Shahjalal International Airport amid cold. Eight of the 312 returnees were sent to hospitals as they had flu symptoms similar to those of coronavirus, and the rest now fear that, with limited washroom facilities at the camp, anyone carrying the new virus in an incubated state can spread it. “Many of us are using only one toilet. It has only one bucket. But it is necessary to keep clean to prevent the disease,” one of the evacuees, Reza Sultanuzzaman, told bdnews24.com via a mobile phone app. Reza, an assistant professor at Nanchang University, said the Bangladeshi authorities were not even following rules of quarantine, which he said means “total isolation”. The mosquito menace has made the situation worse, adding fears of dengue fever, he said. “It seems we are facing more danger here than we we did there. They [authorities] said the condition will improve gradually. But it’s not something to improve day by day. They should have arranged everything before we arrived,” he said. A researcher of another university at Wuhan, requesting anonymity, said they were feeling helpless after being put in the camp. “No one has provided us with a mask. Men, women, children, all have been kept at the same place. Everyone had been advised to drink at least two litre s of water a day, but we got only two half-litre bottles per head. There’s no provision for hot water either,” the researcher said. He also said no one conducted any medical test on them at the camp until 7pm though they had been told that they would frequently undergo the tests. “A doctor now tells me they won’t conduct medical check-up unless someone shows the symptoms. They should not keep us here if they don‘t conduct the tests,” he added.    “He has been kept along with seven others in a room. My son will get infected if someone else carries the virus. I am worried,” he said. Sharifuzzaman, the father of another returnee, Sadman Sharif, is happy that his son has returned. “The condition at his university there was not bad. But it can’t be said how the situation would develop. So I had asked him to come. Now I have no worries,” he said. Mushtuq Husain, who has recently retired as the chief scientific officer at the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research, said generally not so many people are kept together in quarantine. “But we had to do it because we don’t have any structured quarantine facility,” said Mushtuq, whom the government’s diseases arm IEDCR is consulting to deal with the evacuation and isolation of the Bangladeshis. “There will be no problem because anyone else cannot get in from outside. And if someone shows the symptoms, he or she will be in total isolation,” he added. Abul Kalam Azad, the director general of health services, said they had tried their best to make it a “true quarantine”. A joint medical team of the directorate and the Combined Military Hospital had been assigned to work at Ashkona round the clock, he said. He also said not all the evacuees would have to remain at the camp for 14 days – the incubation period of the new virus. “We will assess them. If we see there’s no cause for concern, they will be released earlier than schedule,” he said."

Bangladeshi describes her lonely fight to prevent coronavirus in Wuhan,02 February 2020 09:56 PM,One of the few Bangladeshis who have stayed back in the Chinese city of Wuhan after the evacuation of 312 nationals has described how the thoughts of preventing a coronavirus outbreak have occupied her mind.,"Jannatun Nahar Liza, a Bangladeshi PhD researcher in Huazhong University of Science and Technology, says her days there are “not so bad but lonely”. “Many of my compatriots and Chinese friends have left and I don’t know exactly when they can come back and when I can go out. I miss them a lot, hope they are healthy,” she told bdnews24.com in an email on Sunday. Her research is related to carbon molecules at the university’s College of Materials Science and Engineering. The Chinese city of Wuhan has been empty since Jan 23 as many people left for the spring festival before the start of a lockdown clamped to prevent a deadly coronavirus from spreading further, she said. “No one has come back, and it looks like Wuhan and I are having the longest, never- ending spring festival,” Liza said. The eerie silence has made her everyday life “very simple and lazy” but she is still trying to keep herself active by joining a volunteer group that provides free foods to the international students. Liza has opted for the morning duty. “It’s really hard to get up in the morning amid winter cold, but the responsibility for the group pushes me to get up early in the morning. It is also helping me do my morning exercise along with my work,” she said. To reduce the risk of infection, she takes a hot bath after the work. “This bath is the best part of the day and very refreshing.” By midday, she is served her lunch by other fellow volunteers. “I have my lunch while listening to some music. Then I walk a bit inside my room, hoping that this simple exercise will boost my energy and immunity to fight infection if I contract the virus,” Liza said. “But after 15 minutes of walk, I am always taking a nap, probably affected by the laziness. Sometimes even music feels so boring. After the nap, I freshen up and have some snacks or fruits, which I hope will do good to my health as well,” she added. By 4:30-5pm, her dinner is served to her room. It’s a Chinese tradition to finish dinner by 5pm, she said. She still couldn’t get used to the system so she saves her dinner for 8pm. “This makes the evening really lazy and long. Sometimes my friends come to accompany me, which is very rare at this time.” Liza said she goes out for a walk to buy fruits or snacks from nearby shops when she gets too bored. “I spend the days thinking about ways to keep myself healthy and strong while doing other things.” She said the “hardest part” is that she cannot touch her cat anymore as it is strictly forbidden to go near animals to reduce the risk of infection. “She lives inside my residence and follows me wherever I go but I just can’t pat her like before. It saddens me. (But) I am happy when I watch her eat,” Liza said."
"In China coronavirus clouds, there may be a silver lining for Bangladesh exports",03 February 2020 02:58 AM,"When the world is fighting a new coronavirus outbreak tooth and nail, some analysts and businesses believe the outbreak in China may augur well for Bangladesh’s economy by boosting its dipping exports.","The risk of escalation of a conflict in the Middle East following the recent US killing of a top Iranian military commander in Iraq had snuffed out Bangladesh’s chances for a turnaround in export earnings after a slight growth in December following a four-month decline. Now the coronavirus outbreak may force the US, European countries and others to divert readymade garment orders to Bangladesh, the second largest apparel exporter after China. “No country will buy goods from China for many more days in this situation. The orders destined for China may come to Bangladesh in that case. It may cast off the shadow from our export earnings,” Ahsan H Mansur, executive director of the Policy Research Institute, told bdnews24.com on Sunday. Rubana Huq, the president of the association of entrepreneurs of the largest exporting sector readymade garment, believes so. The effect will be “temporary”, she added.  Bangladesh is the second largest apparel exporter after China.  “Sales are expected to drop and therefore sourcing of products may also decrease,” she said. “On the other hand, some immediate orders from China will be shifted. And major contenders are Vietnam, Cambodia and maybe Bangladesh, if fortune favours us. But this is temporary,” the BGMEA chief said. Bangladesh exported goods worth $19.3 billion in the first half of 2019-20 with a 5.84 percent drop year-on-year and missing the target by 12.77 percent. Mansur also warned that a pandemic outbreak of the virus across the world, or a further spread in China, will bring the global economy, including Bangladesh’s, it its knees. “Because every country has trade relations with China,” he said. The new virus has claimed over 300 lives with the first death outside China reported on Sunday. “Now everything depends on how bad the situation will get,” Mansur said."
SARS stung the global economy. The coronavirus is a greater menace,03 February 2020 02:55 PM,"In 2002, when a lethal, pneumonialike virus known as SARS emerged in China, the country’s factories were mostly churning out low-cost goods like T-shirts and sneakers for customers around the world.","Seventeen years later, another deadly virus is spreading rapidly through the world’s most populous country. But China has evolved into a principal element of the global economy, making the epidemic a substantially more potent threat to fortunes. International companies that rely on Chinese factories to make their products and depend on Chinese consumers for sales are already warning of costly problems. Apple, Starbucks and Ikea have temporarily closed stores in China. Shopping malls are deserted, threatening sales of Nike sneakers, Under Armour clothing and McDonald’s hamburgers. Factories making cars for General Motors and Toyota are delaying production as they wait for workers to return from the Lunar New Year holiday, which has been extended by the government to halt the spread of the virus. International airlines, including American, Delta, United, Lufthansa and British Airways, have cancelled flights to China. China’s economic growth is expected to slip this year to 5.6%, down from 6.1% last year, according to a conservative forecast from Oxford Economics that is based on the effect of the virus so far. That would, in turn, reduce global economic growth for the year by 0.2%, to an annual rate of 2.3% — the slowest pace since the global financial crisis a decade ago. In a sign of deepening concern, China’s leaders on Sunday outlined plans to inject fresh credit into the economy when trading resumes on Monday. That will include a net $22 billion to shore up money markets as well as looser borrowing terms for Chinese companies. Stock markets around the world have plunged in recent days as the sense takes hold that a public health crisis could morph into an economic shock. Though China’s factories still produce a mind-bending array of relatively simple, low-value products like clothing and plastic goods, they have long since achieved dominance in more advanced and lucrative pursuits like smartphones, computers and auto parts. The country has evolved into an essential part of the global supply chain, producing components needed by factories from Mexico to Malaysia. China has also risen into an enormous consumer market, a nation of 1.4 billion people with a growing appetite for electronic gadgets, fashion apparel and trips to Disneyland. The trade war waged by the Trump administration has prompted a partial decoupling of the United States and China, the two largest economies on earth. Multinational companies that have used factories in China to make their wares have sought to avoid American tariffs by shifting production to other countries — especially Vietnam. The coronavirus might accelerate that trend, at least for a time, should global companies find themselves locked out of China. The outbreak of the virus in Wuhan, a city that is home to 11 million people, prompted the Chinese government to effectively quarantine the metropolis and much of surrounding Hubei province, barring people from moving around. Until now, the effect on factories was limited by the fact that the outbreak was unfolding during the Lunar New Year, the most important holiday of the year. Many businesses are closed during the holiday, while hundreds of millions of migrant workers return home to their families in the countryside. In a bid to keep people home and halt the spread of the virus, the government extended the holiday through Sunday, adding three days. But the fear of the virus is so widespread and intense that many workers are likely to remain away from factory towns this week. A frightening epidemic coinciding with a major holiday will almost certainly spell a substantial loss of sales for China’s tourism and hospitality industries. Hotels and restaurants that would normally be full of revelry are empty. Concerts and sporting events have been cancelled. IMAX, the large screen film company based in Toronto, has postponed the release of five films it had intended to showcase in China during the holiday. Even as the holiday officially ends, business is unlikely to return to normal. Many major industrial areas — including Shanghai, Suzhou and Guangdong province — have lengthened the holiday by at least another week, preventing workers from returning. With flights to China limited and emergency public health restrictions in place, the Chinese operations of multinational companies are likely to be constrained. Major banks, including Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase, are directing that employees who have visited mainland China stay home for two weeks. General Motors last year sold more cars in China than in the United States. Its Chinese factories will be closed for at least another week at the request of the government. Ford Motor Co has told managers in China to work from home while its factories remain idled, said a company spokesman. All of this could play havoc with businesses that depend on China for components, from auto factories in the American Midwest and Mexico to apparel plants in Bangladesh and Turkey. If customers cannot buy what they need from China, Chinese factories could, in turn, slash orders for imported machinery, components and raw material — computer chips from Taiwan and South Korea, copper from Chile and Canada, factory equipment from Germany and Italy. “This could potentially disrupt global supply chains,” said Rohini Malkani, an economist at DBRS Morningstar, a global credit rating business. “It’s too early to say how long it is going to last.” Similar worries accompanied the outbreak of SARS in 2002 and 2003, when the virus emerged in the southern province of Guangdong before spreading across China and around the world, killing nearly 800 people in at least 17 countries. China had just joined the World Trade Organization, gaining access to markets around the globe. It was harnessing its seemingly limitless supply of low-wage workers to produce cheap consumer goods. Its economy centred on exports. Its consumer market remained in its infancy. In the years since, China’s annual economic output has multiplied more than eightfold, to nearly $14 trillion from $1.7 trillion, according to the World Bank. Its share of global trade has more than doubled, to 12.8% last year from 5.3% in 2003, according to Oxford Economics. Its economic output per person has multiplied to roughly $9,000 last year from about $1,500 in 2003, giving households additional cash for an enormous range of consumer goods. “China today accounts for about one-third of global economic growth, a larger share of global growth than from the US, Europe and Japan combined,” Andy Rothman, an economist at Matthews Asia, an investment fund manager, noted during recent testimony before a congressional panel. The US semiconductor industry is particularly entrenched in China, which is both a major manufacturing hub and a market for its products. Intel’s customers in China accounted for about $20 billion in revenue in 2019, or 28% of its total for the year. Qualcomm, the dominant maker of chips for mobile phones, is even more dependent on China, drawing 47% of its annual revenue — or nearly $12 billion — from sales in the country. No one knows how long the coronavirus outbreak will last. It is impossible to calculate the extent to which it will disrupt China’s economy. But China’s formidable stature in the world economy means that the effect of the current outbreak is likely to substantially exceed that of SARS. “The knock-on effects for the global economy are going to be much larger than they were,” said Nicholas R Lardy, a China expert at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. For manufacturers, the timing of the outbreak may limit the damage. They just completed the fourth quarter, when production increases to meet demand for the winter holidays. The end of January is typically slow. But the effects of the virus on supply chains, which have grown notoriously complex, are difficult to anticipate. A single part of an advanced product like a smart TV may be made of dozens of smaller components, with each of these assembled from other pieces. Companies themselves often do not know the suppliers that are three and four rungs down the chain. “If you run out of widgets that are essential to production processes and all those widgets come from China, then it may well be that your production lines go to a halt,” said Ben May, global economist at Oxford Economics in London. “These problems are likely to be popping up all over the world.” This became a problem in the aftermath of the 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan, which devastated manufacturers. Many companies assumed they were buying parts from a diverse range of suppliers, protecting them from shortages, only to realise that critical components were produced by single plants. If that plays out in China, the consequences are likely to be great. “We’re talking about a potentially vast swath of a country that the whole world depends on as a manufacturing workshop,” said Susan Helper, an economist at Case Western Reserve University and the former chief economist at the Commerce Department. “The effects will be unexpected.” Apple assembles most of its products in China. The company has severely restricted travel in China for its employees, its chief executive officer, Tim Cook, said on an earnings call Tuesday. Apple disclosed much wider volatility in its potential revenues for the current quarter in the face of uncertainties around factory production and sales of its products. Those uncertainties deepened on Saturday. Apple, which derives about one-sixth of its sales from China, announced that it would close its 42 stores in the country. Walmart buys vast volumes of its products from Chinese factories while operating 430 stores in the country, including in areas shut down by quarantine. The company has reduced hours at some stores, a Walmart spokeswoman said. “We may still be in the early stages,” of the coronavirus crisis, Judith McKenna, who runs Walmart’s International business, wrote in an internal memo on Friday. China is the world’s largest toy manufacturer. At the International Toy Fair in Nuremberg, Germany, many Chinese suppliers expressed confidence that their factories would soon reopen, said Rick Woldenberg, chief executive of Learning Resources, a manufacturer of educational products and toys in Illinois. “But no one’s quite sure how much of this information can be relied upon,” Woldenberg said. Because of the trade war, the toy industry was effectively prepared for a moment in which its access to Chinese suppliers was imperilled, Woldenberg said. In December, when the Trump administration was threatening to impose an additional 15% tariff on Chinese imports, many toy companies sped up their orders to beat the deadline. Some shifted production to Thailand and Vietnam. Toymakers will soon need to rebuild inventory. “If this goes on for four more months, we are talking about a big problem,” said Jim Silver, chief executive of TTPM.com, a consumer research site. After SARS, China suffered several months of economic contraction and then rebounded significantly. That might happen this time, too. The only certainty is this: Whatever happens in China will be felt widely. “Clearly China has become a much more dominant player in the world economy,” said May of Oxford Economics. “It’s just so much more involved in the global supply chain. Over the last decade, it has been the spender of last resort for the global economy.”  c.2020 The New York Times Company"
"Eight China returnees test negative for coronavirus, says IEDCR",03 February 2020 05:43 PM,Eight of the 312 Bangladeshis evacuated from the Chinese city of Wuhan have tested negative for the coronavirus.,"Prof Dr Meerjady Sabrina Flora, the director of Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research, confirmed the matter on Monday. “I received the test results yesterday. Nobody was found to be infected with the virus,” said Dr Flora. “Those who were staying at Kurmitola General Hospital were sent to Ashkona Hajj camp last night. However, one was sent back to Kurmitola for monitoring after he was found to have a high body temperature.” The other China returnee at the Combined Military Hospital is being kept there as she is pregnant, said Flora. A total of 312 Bangladeshis were brought back to Dhaka from the Chinese city of Wuhan, the locked down epicentre of a deadly coronavirus outbreak that has sparked a global health emergency. Eight of the returnees were found to have high body temperatures. Of them, seven were sent to Kurmitola General Hospital and one to Combined Military Hospital. Bangladesh has screened 5,631 China returnees until Sunday, said IEDCR. A total of 34 coronavirus suspects have tested negative for the virus."
Mask prices surge in Bangladesh amid coronavirus scare,04 February 2020 12:02 AM,Traders have hiked the price of face masks amid mounting fears in Bangladesh over a deadly coronavirus which has originated in China and killed over 360 people so far.,"A surge in demand triggering a shortage of mask stocks has driven up the price, according to them. Although the majority of face masks in the Bangladeshi market come from China, many, including Chinese nationals, are stocking up on the product to send it back to the virus-hit country, say wholesalers.    Bangladesh is yet to diagnose a case of the infection despite running tests on Chinese nationals living in the country as well as the 312 Bangladeshis who have recently returned from the coronavirus epicentre Wuhan.

SARS stung the global economy. The coronavirus is a greater menace,05 February 2020 02:59 AM,"In 2002, when a lethal, pneumonialike virus known as SARS emerged in China, the country’s factories were mostly churning out low-cost goods like T-shirts and sneakers for customers around the world.","Seventeen years later, another deadly virus is spreading rapidly through the world’s most populous country. But China has evolved into a principal element of the global economy, making the epidemic a substantially more potent threat to fortunes. International companies that rely on Chinese factories to make their products and depend on Chinese consumers for sales are already warning of costly problems. Apple, Starbucks and Ikea have temporarily closed stores in China. Shopping malls are deserted, threatening sales of Nike sneakers, Under Armour clothing and McDonald’s hamburgers. Factories making cars for General Motors and Toyota are delaying production as they wait for workers to return from the Lunar New Year holiday, which has been extended by the government to halt the spread of the virus. International airlines, including American, Delta, United, Lufthansa and British Airways, have cancelled flights to China. China’s economic growth is expected to slip this year to 5.6%, down from 6.1% last year, according to a conservative forecast from Oxford Economics that is based on the impact of the virus so far. That would, in turn, reduce global economic growth for the year by 0.2%, to an annual rate of 2.3% — the slowest pace since the global financial crisis a decade ago.  People wearing protective masks are seen in an Apple Store, as China is hit by an outbreak of the new coronavirus, in Shanghai, China, January 29, 2020. Reuters  In a sign of deepening concern, China’s leaders on Sunday outlined plans to inject fresh credit into the economy. That will include a net $22 billion to shore up money markets as well as looser borrowing terms for Chinese companies. Though China’s factories still produce a mind-bending array of relatively simple, low-value products like clothing and plastic goods, they have long since achieved dominance in more advanced and lucrative pursuits like smartphones, computers and auto parts. The country has evolved into an essential part of the global supply chain, producing components needed by factories from Mexico to Malaysia. China has also risen into an enormous consumer market, a nation of 1.4 billion people with a growing appetite for electronic gadgets, fashion apparel and trips to Disneyland. The trade war waged by the Trump administration has prompted a partial decoupling of the United States and China, the two largest economies on earth. Multinational companies that have used factories in China to make their wares have sought to avoid American tariffs by shifting production to other countries — especially Vietnam. The coronavirus might accelerate that trend, at least for a time, should global companies find themselves locked out of China. The outbreak of the virus in Wuhan, a city that is home to 11 million people, prompted the Chinese government to effectively quarantine the metropolis and much of surrounding Hubei province, barring people from moving around. Until now, the impact on factories was limited by the fact that the outbreak was unfolding during the Lunar New Year, the most important holiday of the year. Many businesses are closed during the holiday, while hundreds of millions of migrant workers return home to their families in the countryside.  A woman walks through an empty shopping mall in Beijing, Feb 1, 2020. In the nearly 20 years since SARS, China’s importance in the global economy has grown exponentially. (Giulia Marchi/The New York Times)  A frightening epidemic coinciding with a major holiday will almost certainly spell a substantial loss of sales for China’s tourism and hospitality industries. Hotels and restaurants that would normally be full of revelry are empty. Concerts and sporting events have been cancelled. IMAX, the large screen film company based in Toronto, has postponed the release of five films it had intended to showcase in China during the holiday. Even as the holiday officially ends, business is unlikely to return to normal. Many major industrial areas — including Shanghai, Suzhou and Guangdong province — have lengthened the holiday by at least another week, preventing workers from returning. With flights to China limited and emergency public health restrictions in place, the Chinese operations of multinational companies are likely to be constrained. Major banks, including Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase, are directing that employees who have visited mainland China stay home for two weeks. General Motors last year sold more cars in China than in the United States. Its Chinese factories will be closed for at least another week at the request of the government. Ford Motor Co. has told managers in China to work from home while its factories remain idled, said a company spokesman. All of this could play havoc with businesses that depend on China for components, from auto factories in the American Midwest and Mexico to apparel plants in Bangladesh and Turkey. If customers cannot buy what they need from China, Chinese factories could, in turn, slash orders for imported machinery, components and raw material — computer chips from Taiwan and South Korea, copper from Chile and Canada, factory equipment from Germany and Italy. “This could potentially disrupt global supply chains,” said Rohini Malkani, an economist at DBRS Morningstar, a global credit rating business. “It’s too early to say how long it is going to last.” Similar worries accompanied the outbreak of SARS in 2002 and 2003, when the virus emerged in the southern province of Guangdong before spreading across China and around the world, killing nearly 800 people in at least 17 countries. China had just joined the World Trade Organization, gaining access to markets around the globe. It was harnessing its seemingly limitless supply of low-wage workers to produce cheap consumer goods. Its economy centred on exports. Its consumer market remained in its infancy.  A nearly deserted road outside Beijing Capital International Airport, which is usually choked with traffic, in China on Feb 3, 2020. The Chinese capital, like other cities far from the epidemic’s centre, has imposed restrictions and shut down public spaces, straining the ties that bind society. (Giulia Marchi/The New York Times)  Its economic output per person has multiplied to roughly $9,000 last year from about $1,500 in 2003, giving households additional cash for an enormous range of consumer goods. “China today accounts for about one-third of global economic growth, a larger share of global growth than from the US, Europe and Japan combined,” Andy Rothman, an economist at Matthews Asia, an investment fund manager, noted during recent testimony before a congressional panel. The US semiconductor industry is particularly entrenched in China, which is both a major manufacturing hub and a market for its products. Intel’s customers in China accounted for about $20 billion in revenue in 2019, or 28% of its total for the year. Qualcomm, the dominant maker of chips for mobile phones, is even more dependent on China, drawing 47% of its annual revenue — or nearly $12 billion — from sales in the country. No one knows how long the coronavirus outbreak will last, how far it will spread, or how many lives it will claim. It is impossible to calculate the extent to which it will disrupt China’s economy. But China’s formidable stature in the world economy means that the impact of the current outbreak is likely to substantially exceed that of SARS. “The knock-on effects for the global economy are going to be much larger than they were,” said Nicholas R. Lardy, a China expert at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. For manufacturers, the timing of the outbreak may limit the damage. They just completed the fourth quarter, when production increases to meet demand for the winter holidays. The end of January is typically slow. But the effects of the virus on supply chains, which have grown notoriously complex, are difficult to anticipate. A single part of an advanced product like a smart TV may be made of dozens of smaller components, with each of these assembled from other pieces. Companies themselves often do not know the suppliers that are three and four rungs down the chain. “If you run out of widgets that are essential to production processes and all those widgets come from China, then it may well be that your production lines go to a halt,” said Ben May, global economist at Oxford Economics in London. “These problems are likely to be popping up all over the world.” This became a problem in the aftermath of the 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan, which devastated manufacturers. Many companies assumed they were buying parts from a diverse range of suppliers, protecting them from shortages, only to realise that critical components were produced by single plants. If that plays out in China, the consequences are likely to be great. “We’re talking about a potentially vast swath of a country that the whole world depends on as a manufacturing workshop,” said Susan Helper, an economist at Case Western Reserve University and the former chief economist at the Commerce Department. “The effects will be unexpected.” Apple assembles most of its products in China. The company has severely restricted travel in China for its employees, its chief executive officer, Tim Cook, said on an earnings call Tuesday. Apple disclosed much wider volatility in its potential revenues for the current quarter in the face of uncertainties around factory production and sales of its products. Those uncertainties deepened on Saturday. Apple, which derives about one-sixth of its sales from China, announced that it would close its 42 stores in the country. Walmart buys vast volumes of its products from Chinese factories while operating 430 stores in the country, including in areas shut down by quarantine. The company has reduced hours at some stores, a Walmart spokeswoman said. “We may still be in the early stages,” of the coronavirus crisis, Judith McKenna, who runs Walmart’s International business, wrote in an internal memo on Friday. China is the world’s largest toy manufacturer. At the International Toy Fair in Nuremberg, Germany, many Chinese suppliers expressed confidence that their factories would soon reopen, said Rick Woldenberg, chief executive of Learning Resources, a family-owned manufacturer of educational products and toys in Illinois. “But no one’s quite sure how much of this information can be relied upon,” Woldenberg said. Because of the trade war, the toy industry was effectively prepared for a moment in which its access to Chinese suppliers was imperilled, Woldenberg said. In December, when the Trump administration was threatening to impose an additional 15% tariff on Chinese imports, many toy companies sped up their orders to beat the deadline. Some shifted production to Thailand and Vietnam to avoid the tariffs altogether. Toymakers will soon need to rebuild inventory. “If this goes on for four more months, we are talking about a big problem,” said Jim Silver, chief executive of TTPM.com, a consumer research site. After SARS, China suffered several months of economic contraction and then rebounded dramatically. That might happen this time, too. The only certainty is this: Whatever happens in China will be felt widely. “Clearly China has become a much more dominant player in the world economy,” said May of Oxford Economics. “It’s just so much more involved in the global supply chain. Over the last decade, it has been the spender of last resort for the global economy.”  ©2020 The New York Times Company"
"Don’t get misled, panicked by coronavirus rumours on social media: IEDCR director",06 February 2020 04:05 AM,"Rumours about the new coronavirus are spreading on social media in Bangladesh amid a deadly outbreak in China, the chief of the government’s disease control agency has said.","Meerjady Sabrina Flora, the director of the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research or IEDCR, has urged the people not to get confused or panicked by the rumours. “Rumours are spreading on social media about many types of treatment. But no specific treatment for the disease is available just yet. So, the people must not get confused or panicked by such publications,” she said while briefing the media at the institute in Dhaka on Wednesday on the steps to reduce the risks of an outbreak.    The institute, the sole provider of the coronavirus test in the country, is also sending samples from the patients to the World Health Organization for confirmation. The authorities brought back 312 Bangladeshis from China’s Wuhan, a city in the epicentre of the outbreak, on Saturday. As many as 11 of the evacuees, including a child with fever and his family members, have been kept at the Combined Military Hospital and three others at the Kurmitola General Hospital for flu-like symptoms that are similar to those of coronavirus, Flora said. The rest of the returnees have been quarantined at Ashkona Hajj Camp."
"Not all need to use face masks, IEDCR says as coronavirus scare drives prices",06 February 2020 07:48 PM,"In the wake of a rise in prices of face masks amid coronavirus scare, the government’s disease control agency says not everyone needs protection as no one from China, hit by a deadly outbreak, has tested positive and the evacuees have been quarantined.","Only sick returnees from China and those taking care of them will need the protective masks, according to the director of the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research or IEDCR. “Many are confused about the use of mask. Novel coronavirus has not been found in our country yet. And we have kept the returnees from China in isolation. So not everyone needs to use mask,” Meerjady Sabrina Flora told a news conference on Thursday. “The returnees from China who show symptoms, such as fever, cold or sore throat, will need to use mask. Those taking care of them can also use mask,” she said.

Many are using masks on the streets while wholesalers say some Chinese nationals are stocking up on the product to send it back to the virus-hit country. Traders have hiked the price of face masks amid the mounting demand. They are charging up to Tk 500 for a 60-piece box of face masks, up from only Tk 60 weeks ago.  "
"11 China returnees test negative for coronavirus, says IEDCR",07 February 2020 02:33 PM,"Eleven of the 312 Bangladeshis evacuated from the Chinese city of Wuhan, have tested negative for the coronavirus.","Prof Dr Meerjady Sabrina Flora, the director of Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research, confirmed the matter on Friday. They underwent medical tests after being found to have high body temperatures and are currently in quarantine at the Combined Military Hospital or CMH, said Flora. The novel coronavirus was first detected in China’s Hubei province on Dec 31, 2019. It has since infected 31,143 in China alone before spreading to over 25 countries globally. The Bangladesh government subsequently brought back 312 of its citizens from the locked down city of Wuhan in a special flight on Feb 1. They have since been undergoing quarantine for 14 days, the incubation period for the virus. But the other 301 returnees currently under observation at the Ashkona Hajj Camp are all in good health, said the IEDCR director. The IEDCR has screened 8,396 travellers arriving in Dhaka’s Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport from China as of Friday morning, said Flora. None of them were found to be infected with the virus, she added. “The doctors and cabin crews who returned from China are now undergoing quarantine at their homes. We advised them not to move around for now.”"
Bangladeshi students in Yichang appeal for evacuation amid coronavirus lockdown,07 February 2020 09:29 PM,"A group of Bangladeshi students stuck in Yichang, a city in Hubei province of China, have appealed for evacuation citing a shortage of food and lockdown for a coronavirus outbreak.","As many as 172 Bangladesh nationals studying at the Three Gorges University in the locked down city have been affected by the restrictions, according to some of them. They said they want to return home like the 312 Bangladeshis who had been evacuated from Wuhan, another city some 285 kilometres from Yichang and at the heart of the epidemic. “We are short on food and drinking water. The situation is getting more miserable by the day,” said Abu Saleh, a civil engineering student at the university. He urged the foreign ministry and the Bangladesh Embassy in China to urgently arrange their exit from the city. “We want to return to Bangladesh.” Saleh said they cannot go out of their residential hall as the entire city is under lockdown with public transport, shops, banks and other services suspended for over two weeks. The university has also been shut.  Photo: Faysal Ahmed Anik Photo: Faysal Ahmed Anik  Most of the infections and deaths occurred in Wuhan, from where Bangladesh brought back the 312 nationals on Feb 1. The evacuees are under observation in isolation. Those stranded in Yichang say the nearby cities were in the same state as Wuhan but the media were not giving any importance to the condition of the other cities. “Even the food supplied by the university authorities from the canteen is not enough,” said Dwin Muhammad Priyo, another student of the Three Gorges University.  Photo: Faysal Ahmed Anik Photo: Faysal Ahmed Anik  “Whenever we contact people in Bangladesh, they say a decision to bring us back has been taken and the embassy has been informed. But the embassy officials say they are awaiting a decision from back home. This is confusing. Our only wish now is to return home,” he added. Faisal Ahmed Anik, a mechanical engineering student at the university, said they have holed up in their rooms for 20 days. “Now there is a shortage of food and water. We are getting stuff we require urgently three to four days later,” he said. Anik also said the US, the UK, India, Nepal, Morocco, Afghanistan and Uzbekistan have brought back their nationals from the university. “But we see no such effort for us,” he said. Khairul Bashar, the first secretary at the embassy, denied the allegations against it as well as the students’ claim about a lack of food and water.  Photo: Faysal Ahmed Anik Photo: Faysal Ahmed Anik  “They are ordering rice, lentil, salt, onion to cook themselves at the dormitory. But it takes time. It’s impossible for the university to provide at once whatever the students want in this situation.” Asked why an embassy official left the social media group of the students, Khairul said, “Anyone can enter the group for information and then leave. I see no problem here.” “Would we be able to keep our jobs if we defied (orders from) Dhaka?” he asked, in response to another allegation. After the evacuation from Wuhan, Cabinet Secretary Khandker Anwarul Islam said on Feb 3 that 171 more Bangladeshis were stranded due to the lockdown. The government “wants to bring them back”, but the problem is about who will fly and crew the plane, the secretary had said. “No country is letting in the pilots of the Wuhan flight. There have been discussions on the issue. If we can find a plane to charter, that will be the best option. And in that case Chinese planes will be the first preference,” he had added."
Turkish clothes makers see orders shifting from coronavirus-hit China,07 February 2020 11:20 PM,"Several fashion retailers that manufacture clothing in coronavirus-hit China are in talks with Turkish firms about shifting production to Turkey, two sector officials told Reuters, with one predicting new orders worth up to $2 billion.","An outbreak of the newly-identified coronavirus has killed 637 people in mainland China, where it is believed to have started, prompting many factories to suspend operations until next week or later as authorities try to contain its spread. Polish fashion retailer LPP has said it is in talks with factories in Turkey, Bangladesh and Vietnam as a backup plan if Chinese production delays continue. Turkish manufacturers have in recent years shifted their clothing production up-market as China's dominance grew globally. But the outbreak has sent some European companies back to Turkey, the officials said. ""Purchasing managers and designers can't go to China due to coronavirus worries and travel restrictions. So several well-known brands started discussions for production of new seasonal items in Turkey,"" said Hadi Karasu, head of Turkish Clothing Manufacturers' Association (TGSD). Rising Chinese manufacturing costs and a 36% slide in the value of the Turkish lira in the last two years, on the back of a currency crisis in 2018, has already made Turkey an affordable option, Karasu added. ""As manufacturing costs levelled between China and Turkey, some European firms were (already) considering shifting orders towards here,"" Karasu said. ""China has some $170 billion ready-to-wear exports,"" he added. ""According to our calculations some 1% of orders will (now) be shifting to Turkey initially which could amount to $2 billion."" Turkey exported some $17.7 billion ready-to-wear products last year. Any rise could help the import-heavy economy keep a lid on its current account deficit and hit the government's ambitious 5% economic growth forecast this year. Mustafa Gultepe, head of the Istanbul Apparel Exporters' Association (IHKIB), said the sector has capacity to take on additional orders as both new and existing clients increasingly contact Turkish factories. ""There are clothing retailers asking around for prices and products in Turkey after the coronavirus outbreak,"" Gultepe said. ""I think the impact of the outbreak will continue for 5-6 months...and I think there will be a major shift from China that we will see after May,"" he added."
Bangladesh to screen all inbound travellers amid coronavirus scare,08 February 2020 01:09 PM,Temperature screening measures at airports and other ports of entry into Bangladesh have been extended to cover all inbound travellers in a bid to prevent a deadly coronavirus from spreading.,"The Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research or IEDCR, the  government’s disease wing, announced the move at a media briefing on Saturday. Previously, only travellers arriving in the country from China were required to undergo screening tests. But the virus has killed over 700 people since its outbreak in China's Wuhan late last year and cases have since been confirmed in 25 countries around the world. Meerjady Sabrina Flora, the director of IEDCR, said all planes arriving at airports in the country are being screened in an effort to stem the virus as it can be transmitted from one person to another.""It would have been enough to screen passengers arriving from China and a few other countries. But we have expanded the measure to cover travellers on all flights as an extra precaution.""The new screening procedure came into effect on Friday and is set to continue until further notice, according to Flora.On whether Bangladesh has the capacity to conduct screening at all ports of entry, Flora said: ""We are working collaboratively with different airlines. They are helping distribute health declaration forms inflight. Their assistance is very important.""""We are supplying handheld scanners to ports that don't have thermal scanners. Both handheld and thermal scanners work in the same way.""Aside from undergoing thermal screening, air travellers are also required to fill in health cards at airports.Travellers found with body temperatures higher than 100 degrees Fahrenheit are initially being kept in an observation room at the airport and later transferred to Kurmitola Hospital if necessary.Passengers coming into the country from China are being asked to contact the IEDCR if they suffer from fever within 14 days from arrival.As many as 8,484 people have undergone screenings as of Saturday, according to the IEDCR. But despite running tests on 53 people, the authorities are yet to detect a case of the virus in the country."
Migrant worker in Singapore is first Bangladeshi coronavirus patient,10 February 2020 12:37 AM,A Bangladeshi migrant worker is among the 43 coronavirus cases confirmed in Singapore.,"The 39-year-old Bangladeshi work pass holder was warded in an isolation room at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases or NCID, the Singapore Ministry of Health said. His symptoms surfaced on Feb 1, he went to a general practitioner clinic on Feb 3, and Changi General Hospital on Feb 5, according to The Straits Times. He was admitted to the intensive care unit at Changi Hospital after a follow-up appointment at Bedok Polyclinic on Feb 7, the newspaper said. He was confirmed to have the disease on Saturday afternoon, and was then transferred to the NCID. Before being hospitalised, he had visited Mustafa Centre in Little India, and stayed at The Leo dormitory in Kaki Bukit, according to the report. He is the first Bangladeshi to have been diagnosed with the disease that has killed more than 800 people in China surpassing the deaths in the 2002-03 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome or SARS. Bangladesh has brought back 312 of its nationals from China’s Wuhan, the heart of the deadly outbreak. The government has also scrapped its plans to evacuate 172 others from the locked down Chinese cities due to the authorities’ failure to arrange any flight amid the coronavirus scare. But none of the Bangladeshis in or from China have tested positive. Over two dozen countries outside China have confirmed a total of 288 coronavirus cases, including the 43 in Singapore, according to the World Health Organization. Around 130,000 Bangladeshis live in the island state, according to estimates. MJH Jabed, the director general for Southeast Asia at the foreign ministry, advised the expatriate Bangladeshis in Singapore to stay alert about coronavirus and contact the Bangladesh high commission there if necessary. He said he had talked to the high commissioner in the evening, but did not have any word on the Bangladeshi coronavirus patient."

Singapore confirms second Bangladeshi coronavirus patient,12 February 2020 12:59 AM,Singapore has confirmed another Bangladeshi coronavirus case among a total of 47 patients.,"The 39-year-old had worked at Seletar Aerospace Heights, the same location where another Bangladeshi was found to have the virus, The Straits Times reported citing the Ministry of Health on Tuesday. Both did not share the same premises, according to the report. Singapore reported two more coronavirus cases, including the Bangladeshi, on Tuesday. The other new coronavirus patient is a 35-year-old Singaporean permanent resident living in Johor Baru, who works at the Resorts World Sentosa casino, The Straits Times said. Neither of them had travelled to China, where the death toll in the epidemic has crossed 1,000. Seven of the patients still in hospital remain in critical condition and in the intensive care unit, the newspaper said quoting the ministry. Nine others have been released after recovery. The latest Bangladeshi national to have been infected by the virus is a Singapore work permit holder. He reported symptoms on Feb 6, went to the general practitioner the next day, and to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases on Monday. Before being admitted to hospital, he had stayed at his rental apartment in Veerasamy Road. He worked in the same location as 39-year-old Bangladeshi national, who had visited Mustafa Centre in Little India before being hospitalised, and who stayed at The Leo dormitory in Kaki Bukit. The ministry said that it has identified 1,124 close contacts as of noon on Tuesday. Of the 1,021 who are still in Singapore, 989 have been contacted and are being quarantined or isolated. Efforts are ongoing to contact the remaining 32 close contacts. Several clusters of patients believed to have been infected via local transmissions have emerged since the first case of coronavirus in Singapore was confirmed on Jan 23. Malaysia, South Korea and Britain have reported patients who are believed to have contracted the virus at an international business conference at Grand Hyatt Singapore hotel from Jan 20 to 22, attended by more than 100 people. The World Health Organization has said that it is working with health ministries of related countries to investigate the incident. Singapore raised its disease outbreak response level to orange on Feb 7 as the coronavirus spread further within the country, with more new cases of unknown origin found."
Bangladesh woman dies of heart attack on rumours son has coronavirus infection,13 February 2020 01:45 AM,A woman has died in Satkhira of heart attack reportedly after she panicked on rumours that her son has been diagnosed with coronavirus on return from India.,"Renuka Roptan, 56, a resident of Patakhali village under Padmapukur union of Shyamnagar Upazila, died on Tuesday night. Her son Ratan Roptan, 35, had recently gone to India to visit their relatives. The health workers at Bhomra Land Port sent him to the Satkhira General Hospital for tests after finding that he was suffering from fever and cold when he returned on Monday. Ratan returned home after giving blood sample for the tests. Later, the local officials of the Directorate General of Health Services looked for him, Padmapukur Union Council Chairman Ataur Rahman said. The officials also called Ataur to confirm the location of Ratan, he said. Meanwhile, rumours spread in the area that Ratan “will be killed as he is diagnosed with coronavirus”, Ataur said. “His mother Renuka panicked when she heard about them. She died after complaining of chest pain in the night,” the union council chairman added. The woman died of a heart attack after panicking because office the rumours spread by locals, Satkhira Civil Surgeon Husain Shafayat said. Ajoy Saha, the health and family planning officer at the Shyamnagar Upazila Health Complex, said Ratan was taken to the Satkhira General Hospital on suspicion that he had contacted coronavirus, but he had fled. “Later the health directorate searched for him. Meanwhile, his mother died of a heart attack due to the rumours. It’s very unfortunate,” he said. Both Shafayat and Ajoy confirmed that Ratan tested coronavirus negative."
Bangladesh screening Maitree Express passengers from India amid coronavirus scare,13 February 2020 02:31 AM,The Directorate General of Health Services is screening the passengers of Maitree Express train that runs on Dhaka-Kolkata route in a precautionary move amid a global outbreak of coronavirus.,"The train passengers from India are undergoing screening at Cantonment Railway Station in Dhaka from Tuesday after similar measures have been taken at airports, land ports and maritime ports, said Meerjady Sabrina Flora, the director of the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research in a press conference on Wednesday. Though the train crosses Benapole Station, no passenger gets down there. The Maitree Express runs between Dhaka and Kolkata five days a week. The train leaves Dhaka on Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday. It leaves Kolkata on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday and Saturday. The health workers did not find any coronavirus patient among the passengers who have undergone screening on return from China. Two Bangladeshis infected with the virus have been hospitalised in Singapore. One of them came in contact with 19 people who were also quarantined. As many as 10 of them were Bangladeshis, Flora said. The government of Singapore will pay for their treatment bill, she said. The new coronavirus since its outbreak in Wuhan, China has killed more than 1,100 people in the country where the number of total infected people has crossed 45,000. It will take 18 more months to get a vaccine for the new coronavirus officially called COVID-19, Tedros Adhanom, the director general of World Health Organization, said at a press conference in Geneva on Tuesday. Flora also noted that it would take quite some time to get the vaccine. Awareness, personal hygiene and discipline are the best ways to prevent the disease, she said. All the 312 Bangladeshis, who were quarantined at the Ashkona Hajj Camp after evacuation from Wuhan, were doing well, she said. They will be kept there until Feb 15. The procedure to release them from there has not been confirmed."
Two more Bangladesh nationals infected with coronavirus in Singapore,13 February 2020 07:57 PM,"Another two Bangladeshi migrant workers in Singapore have been infected with coronavirus, bringing the number of patients from the South Asian nation in the island state to four.","The two new Bangladeshi patients, aged 30 and 37, are linked to a worksite in Seletar Aerospace Heights, The Straits Times reported on Thursday. The worksite is now linked to a cluster of four cases, all of whom are Bangladesh nationals. They are among total 58 coronavirus patients in Singapore, including eight new cases. None of the new cases has recent travel history to China, according to the report. They are all currently warded in isolation rooms at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases, it added. One of the Bangladeshis confirmed to be infected on Thursday fell ill on Feb 7. He reported that he had mostly stayed in his rental apartment in Campbell Lane since he fell sick. The 37-year-old was identified as a close contact of the two previously identified Bangladeshi work pass holders, who both worked at the Seletar Aerospaces Heights worksite. Earlier, the authorities in Bangladesh said the Singapore government would carry the cost of treatment of the coronavirus patients there."
Hasina sends condolences to Xi for coronavirus deaths in China,13 February 2020 09:52 PM,"Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has offered her condolences to Chinese President Xi Jinping for the loss of over 1,350 lives to a coronavirus outbreak.","In a message to Xi on Thursday, she also expressed sympathy for the families of the victims. “It is my firm conviction that the government of China, under your great leadership, will be able to face and stop the aggravation of the situation with utmost capacity and control,” she said. “Establishing a taskforce and building emergency hospitals to address the crisis is timely and praise-worthy,” Hasina added. She also told Xi that her government was ready to extend any help to mitigate the plight of the victims. She thanked the Chinese leadership for taking care of a good number of Bangladeshi citizens living in China “at this tragic moment”. She appreciated that China has become a global model of development under Xi’s “dynamic leadership”. “Your contributions to the international arena, in Asia in particular, are truly appreciable,” Hasina said. She renewed her invitation to the Chinese president to join the inauguration ceremony of Bangabandhu’s birth centenary celebrations on Mar 17."
"They documented the coronavirus crisis in Wuhan, then they vanished",15 February 2020 01:44 PM,"The beige van squatted outside of a Wuhan hospital, its side and back doors ajar. Fang Bin, a local clothing salesman, peered inside as he walked past. He groaned: “So many dead.” He counted five, six, seven, eight body bags. “This is too many.”","That moment, in a 40-minute video about the coronavirus outbreak that has devastated China, propelled Fang to internet fame. Then, less than two weeks later, he disappeared.Days earlier, another prominent video blogger in Wuhan, Chen Qiushi, had also gone missing. Chen’s friends and family said they believed he had been forcibly quarantined.Before their disappearances, Fang and Chen had recorded dozens of videos from Wuhan, streaming unfiltered and often heartbreaking images from the center of the outbreak. Long lines outside hospitals. Feeble patients. Agonized relatives.The footage would have been striking anywhere. But it was especially so coming from inside China, where even mild criticism of the authorities is quickly scrubbed from the online record, and those responsible for it often punished.The appetite for the videos reflects, in part, the shortage of independent news sources in China, where professional newspapers are tightly controlled by the authorities. Earlier this month, the state propaganda department deployed hundreds of journalists to reshape the narrative of the outbreak.But the videos also reflected the growing call for free speech in China in recent weeks, as the coronavirus crisis has prompted criticism and introspection from unexpected corners across the country.Several professional news organizations have produced incisive reports on the outbreak. A revolt against government censorship broke out on Chinese social media last week after the death of Li Wenliang, the Wuhan doctor who had tried to warn of the virus before officials had acknowledged an outbreak.

Singapore confirms fifth Bangladeshi coronavirus patient from Bombardier construction site,15 February 2020 10:42 PM,Singapore has confirmed that a fifth Bangladeshi migrant worker has been diagnosed with coronavirus taking the number of patients with the disease in the city state to 72.,"Like the previous four cases, the latest Bangladeshi patient was working at the Seletar Aerospace Heights construction site, Singapore’s Ministry of Health said on Saturday. The 26 year-old Bangladesh national, a Singapore Work Pass holder, had no recent travel history to China, according to the ministry. The construction work at the site is for expansion of aerospace manufacturer Bombardier Aviation's facilities, The Straits Times reported. The newspaper said on Feb 12 it “understands that the two workers are not involved in any project relating to the Singapore Airshow or Bombardier's other operations in Singapore”. In response to questions, a spokesman for Boustead Projects, which is overseeing the project at the site, said that both workers are employees of a sub-contractor, The Straits Times reported. Besides quarantining close contacts of the coronavirus patients and screening employees, Boustead Projects has suspended all mass meetings at the company's worksites. ""Since the first confirmed case was reported at our project site, we have carried out thorough disinfection of work areas where the first confirmed case had been to, and are doing so for the work areas where the second confirmed case has been to,"" the newspaper quoted the Boustead Projects spokesman as saying. A spokesman for Bombardier said the company was working closely with local health authorities to ensure that the necessary health protocols are followed, according to the report."
Bangladesh sending Wuhan evacuees home after coronavirus clearance,16 February 2020 02:54 AM,"The Bangladeshi evacuees from Wuhan, the epicentre of a coronavirus epidemic in China, have begun returning home following close surveillance in isolation for two weeks.","They underwent their last health check-up at the Ashkona Hajj Camp in Dhaka on Saturday evening while their relatives gathered outside the facility used for quarantine. The returnees finally began to leave and meet their loved ones around 9:30pm. Many travelled home on cars while the rest took BRTC buses that left after 10pm. “It feels very good to get my son after so many days,” said a man who came from Gazipur’s Tongi to receive a student of a university in Wuhan. A doctor from the capital’s Pallabi said he was happy to see his son healthy. He thanked the government for arranging the evacuation. Abul Kalam Azad, the director general of health services, told bdnews24.com around 10pm that 200 evacuees were returning home in Dhaka and adjacent districts in the night. The others whose homes are far away from Dhaka will leave the following morning, he said. “They will stay in touch to inform us about their health,” Azad said. The government brought back 312 Bangladeshis from Wuhan by a special flight on Feb 1. Its disease control agency IEDCR said no one of the returnees showed any symptoms of coronavirus infection. Besides detailing instructions on how they should spend next few days, the IEDCR also provided them with face masks and sanitizers for use at home."
Chinese woman is fourth person admitted to Rangpur Corona Unit,16 February 2020 08:08 PM,A Chinese woman has been admitted to the Rangpur Medical College Hospital’s Corona Unit with fever and breathing problems.,"The 29-year-old patient was working at the Uttara Export Processing Zone in Nilphamari. She was admitted to the unit of the hospital’s Isolation Ward on Sunday afternoon, the hospital’s Assistant Director Rostom Ali said. “It is not confirmed yet whether she is infected by the new coronavirus,” he said. The Chinese national joined her workplace in the northern district on arrival in Dhaka’s Shahjalal International Airport on Feb 4. She was cleared by the health workers who were running thermal screening of travellers from China at the airport, Rostom said. But she fell sick on Saturday, he added. The three previous patients at the unit were Bangladeshi returnees from China. Hailing from Dinajpur, Lalmonirhat and Dinajpur, none of them showed coronavirus symptoms, according to the government’s disease control agency IEDCR. One of them was transferred to a hospital in Dhaka. On Saturday, China recorded more than 2,000 new coronavirus patients that took the total number to 68,500 cases of the illness. Out of the 1,665 deaths, 142 were also reported on Saturday."
Bangladeshi returnee from Singapore hospitalised without illness amid coronavirus scare,17 February 2020 12:10 AM,The authorities have hospitalised a returnee from Singapore even though he was not ill as fears of coronavirus have increased following infection of five Bangladeshis in the island state.,"The man, a migrant worker from Tangail’s Basail, arrived in Shahjalal International Airport in Dhaka last Thursday. He told the media on Sunday that the health workers at the airport allowed him to leave after finding no symptom of coronavirus in thermal screening. “I meet people when I return home on holidays every year. But this time the problem arose as I did not meet anyone,” he said. His mother said her son did not go outside as he was upset with his wife for some reason. “Residents of our neighbourhood then spread rumours that he is infected with coronavirus,” she said. Workers from Basail Upazila Health Complex came and took him to the facility on Sunday. From there, he was transferred to the Tangail General Hospital and finally to a hospital in Dhaka. The man did not show any symptom like fever or respiratory problems similar to those of coronavirus infection, but the doctors referred him to Dhaka for confirmation, said the Tangail hospital’s Resident Medical Officer Sajeeb Ahmed."
Chinese ambassador advises against evacuation of 171 Bangladeshis from virus-hit Hubei province,17 February 2020 10:21 PM,"Chinese Ambassador in Dhaka Li Jiming has advised against evacuating 171 Bangladeshi nationals from the locked-down cities in China's Hubei province, the epicentre of a deadly coronavirus.","Speaking to reporters at the National Press Club on Monday, the envoy said, ""There are risks in bringing them back now."" The novel coronavirus has killed over 1,700 people and infected over 70,000 in China so far, causing great angst among the Bangladeshis who are currently stranded in the country. The first cases in December were traced to a seafood market in the Chinese city of Wuhan, the heart of the epidemic from where Bangladesh evacuated 312 citizens and quarantined them in Dhaka on Feb 1.    Li Jiming used the example of how a Japanese taxi driver transmitted the virus to those who came in contact with him to explain the risks involved in evacuating the Bangladeshi citizens from China. ""They could fall in harm's way if they take a bus out of Yichang. That's why I recommend not bringing them back."" But after a meeting with the Chinese ambassador on Sunday, Foreign Minister AK Abdul Momen said efforts are underway to arrange a safe passage home for the Bangladeshi citizens. On when they would be back home, Momen said it all depends on China's approval. Addressing the matter on Monday, Li Jiming said China will greenlight their evacuation once the Bangladesh government makes the necessary arrangements for it. ""There are no flights from Hubei at this time. Bangladeshi pilots and crew who flew there are being denied entry to other countries. This is a big complication and we are looking for alternatives. The approval is not an issue; the problem lies with the technical matters."""
Singapore builders seek force majeure advice as coronavirus causes labour crunch,18 February 2020 03:25 PM,"Singapore construction firms are asking for advice about whether they have the option of invoking force majeure clauses in building contracts as the government turns away or quarantines Chinese labour to stop the spread of the coronavirus, lawyers told Reuters.","Singapore has an estimated $20-$24 billion of public and private sector building projects in the works this year - and any large impact on the sector, which is highly dependent on foreign labour, could help push the economy into recession. Derek Loh, a partner at Singapore-based TSMP Law Corporation, said five clients involved in public sector construction projects have approached him in recent weeks for advice on force majeure - which refers to unexpected external circumstances that prevent a party to a contract from meeting their obligations. “These clients that have sought advice are largely those that employ Chinese labour,” said Loh. Two other senior lawyers, who declined to be named, said they had also received queries related to force majeure. The Building and Construction Authority, a government agency, has said, however that contractors involved in public sector projects can seek extensions. It has also urged private sector developers to give extensions to contractors that work for them. Some Chinese companies have already invoked force majeure on contracts due to the virus, including China’s top LNG buyer China National Offshore Oil Corp and Jiangsu New Times Shipbuilding Co. Singapore, which has one of the highest numbers of virus infections outside China at 77, has halted the issuance of new visas to Chinese nationals since Jan. 31. Workers from China with existing work visas must seek approval before re-entry, and if approved, must spend 14 days in quarantine. Singapore’s labour ministry said last week it was rejecting 400 applications daily from returning workers with recent travel history to China and had also cancelled some work passes. It has also prevented employers from hiring foreign staff if rules are breached. The Singapore Contractors Association, which has about 3,000 members, has raised the labour shortage issue with authorities, a spokesman said. Construction labourers without any travel history to China have also been infected, with five Bangladeshi workers among confirmed cases. The firm involved, Boustead Projects Ltd (BOUS.SI), said it halted construction activities to disinfect areas and is continuing to assess the impact on the project concerned. The construction sector, which is allowed to hire workers from only a handful of countries including China, India and Bangladesh, expanded 2.8% in 2019, one of the strongest performers in an economy that recorded a growth rate of 0.7%, its slowest in a decade. The last time several construction firms sought to invoke force majeure in Singapore was in 2007 when Indonesia banned sand exports to the city-state bringing building activity almost to a halt."
Coronavirus scare forces Bangladesh to postpone international archery competition,18 February 2020 06:40 PM,Travel restrictions over a deadly coronavirus pandemic have forced Bangladesh to postpone an international archery competition which was to take place in the last week of February.,"Over 200 competitors from 30 countries were expected to take part in the ISSF International Solidarity Championships at the Archery Training Centre of Shaheed Ahsanullah Master Stadium in Gazipur’s Tongi from Feb 23. “But many countries have refused to send their archers due to coronavirus scare. The number of participants has dropped to 70-80. So, we are postponing the tournament for now,” Kazi Rajib Uddin Ahmed Chapol, the general secretary of the Bangladesh Archery Federation, told bdnews24.com on Tuesday. The federation will sit to set a new schedule, he added. Bangladesh has been organising the annual world ranking event since 2017. World Archery, the game’s governing body, said in a report that a number of teams withdrew due to travel restrictions and ongoing concerns around the COVID-19 or coronavirus outbreak. “This meant the event was no longer feasible,” it added. The rapidly spreading coronavirus claimed another 98 lives in mainland China on Monday, bringing the total death toll there to 1,868. There were 1,886 new confirmed infections for a total of 72,436. Outside of China, there are 827 cases in 26 countries and regions and five deaths."
Rumours will put efforts to prevent coronavirus at risk: IEDCR,18 February 2020 09:46 PM,"The government’s disease control agency IEDCR has warned against spreading rumours about coronavirus on social media, saying doing so will jeopardise efforts to prevent an outbreak in Bangladesh.","Rumourmongers were citing news carried locally and internationally to spread disinformation on the issue, Meerjady Sabrina Flora, the director of the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research, said on Tuesday. The rumours may hamper the process to identify coronavirus patients, she told reporters at a daily briefing organised at the institute in Dhaka. The IEDCR has screened 72 people, including three Chinese nationals, on suspicion of coronavirus infection, but they all have tested negative, she said. The 312 returnees from Wuhan, the Chinese city at the heart of the spread of the virus to over two dozen countries, were also doing well after returning home following two weeks of isolation, Flora said. “So we can say that there is no presence of coronavirus in Bangladesh,” she said. “But the mother of a suspected patient died an unfortunate death as a result of rumours. Not only this, panic has been created among locals in some places. It has put personal and social security of some returnees from China and Singapore at risk,” Flora said. Even the local authorities and law enforcement, having been affected by the rumours, were intimidating some returnees from China and Singapore, she said. “Rumours and intimidation will hamper the process to identify possible patients. Such actions will lead the suspected patients to hide information and location. It will put the efforts to identify the patients at risk,” the IEDCR chief said. She urged government officials to contact the IEDCR via phone for advices to conduct activities related to prevention of a possible coronavirus outbreak. The authorities in Tangail forcefully hospitalised a returnee from Singapore even though he was not ill or showing symptoms on Sunday as fears of coronavirus increased following infection of five Bangladeshis in the city state. His mother said rumours spread by locals over his health led to the situation. Another woman in Satkhira died of heart attack on Feb 11 reportedly after she panicked on rumours that her son had been diagnosed with coronavirus on return from India. Flora had earlier urged the people not to get misled or panicked by the rumours spread social media about the nature or treatment of coronavirus. Researchers are yet to find any cure for the flu-like disease that causes breathing problem, among other symptoms."

Gold prices rise in Bangladesh as coronavirus uncertainty hits global market,19 February 2020 03:52 AM,Jewellers in Bangladesh have upped gold prices in a span of one and a half months citing the uncertainty that hangs over the global market due to a coronavirus outbreak in China and the restrictions beyond.,"Bangladesh Jewellers Samity or Bajus raised the prices by Tk 1,166 per Bhori (11.664 grams) across the board in an announcement on Tuesday. The price of best quality gold will be Tk 61,528 a Bhori from Wednesday, New gold prices: 22 carat – Tk 61,528 21 carat – Tk 59,195 18 carat – Tk 54,179 For the traditional method, in which gold is acquired from old ornaments with no agreed standard of purity, the price remains unchanged at Tk 41,407 per Bhori.    Uncertainty over the coronavirus outbreak led to a rise in demand for gold in China and subsequently price hike in the international market, Bajus General Secretary Dilip Kumar Agarwala explained. When gold prices were raised for the last time in early January, jewellers had cited a volatile global market after the death of Iranian commander Qassem Soleimani in a US airstrike in Iraq. Gold prices crossed Tk 60,000 a Bhori at the time. The prices crossed the mark earlier in 2013. In 2003, when the US started the war against Iraq, the prices rose to as high as Tk 70,000."
Bangladeshi man infected with coronavirus in Singapore is in ‘critical’ condition: Momen,19 February 2020 01:43 PM,"A Bangladeshi man diagnosed with a novel coronavirus in Singapore is currently in ‘critical condition', Foreign Minister AK Abdul Momen has said.","Speaking to reporters during an event at Dhaka's Intercontinental Hotel on Wednesday, Momen said: “Singapore’s Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan called me in the morning. He told me one of the five Bangladeshis carrying the virus is in very critical condition.""The 39-year old victim has been in a long battle with various health issues, including breathing and kidney complications, according to the minister.The Singaporean health authorities have not disclosed the names of any of the five expatriate Bangladeshis infected with the virus.The Bangladeshi construction worker in question has been in the Intensive Care Unit for the past 13 days but the situation is raising concerns as medicines are not having any effect on the patient, according to Momen.""Foreign Minister Vivian told me that the virus-infected patients were being given the best medical care.""“The medicines haven't been working since yesterday. However, we guarantee you that we will try our best.”But the necessary arrangements will be made to return the migrant's body home should the worst happen, said Momen, citing his Singaporean counterpart. ""We do not know his name and the Singapore authorities have told us they will not disclose his identity to protect his privacy,"" said Abdul in response to a question."
Bangladesh garment owners ‘concerned’ as China virus disrupts supply,20 February 2020 09:48 PM,"The outbreak of the deadly coronavirus epidemic in China, stopping the regular life in its tracks there, has also affected the major manufacturing and export sectors in Bangladesh, with China being the main country to import goods and raw materials from.","The supply chain has already been disrupted with extended delay to factories reopening and uncertainty about work resuming is setting in as the coronavirus outbreak continues to spread in provinces and cities. The Chinese factories began to roll slowly following the 2020 holiday season, but they could not return to full production due to a lack of factory staffing. Transportation of goods is also halted and the authorities cannot say how long production disruptions will continue in China. The Chinese exporters have told the importers in Bangladesh that things will go back to normal in next 10 to 15 days. China will speed up port activities to make up for the losses, Chinese Ambassador in Dhaka Li Jiming has said. Bangladesh imported goods worth Tk 1.14 trillion from China in the 2018-19 fiscal year, which was 26 percent of its total import. According to the readymade garment industry, China is the sole country to import at least 40 types of raw materials from. These include threads, fabrics, zippers and buttons. Also, toys, electronics, electrical goods, agricultural equipment, onion, ginger, garlic, kinoo, orange, apple, machinery, steel materials, chemicals, shoes, spectacles are also imported from the East Asian nation. The importers have been reluctant to go for alternative markets until now, even though they are available. The Lunar New Year holiday begins in the first week of January in China and lasts about 25 days. The factories generally go back to production by the first week of February. But this year the factories are yet to fire up due to the coronavirus epidemic. Bangladesh makes 92 percent of its export earning form the readymade garment sector. Therefore, this sector is confronting the highest threat emerged due to the coronavirus crisis. The supply chain has been disrupted severely for the past few days and the impact is growing every day, Mashiul Azam Sajal, vice-president of Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association, told bdnews24.com. Nobody knows what will happen ahead but the factory owners are quite worried, he said. “We are losing the orders as well as the supply of raw materials. We can’t even take orders from the buyers -- much less bargain with them. This phase will continue until May, even if the situation in China returns to normal now.” Some of the offices in China could go back to work but not the factories, as 60 percent of the workers could not come to factories, he said. Many of the factories in Bangladesh have had three to four of their production lines stopped. There will be more unemployment if the crisis lingers as the factories would not be able to pay the wages of their hundreds of workers, said Sajal. Competitors in the garment sector – Vietnam, Cambodia, Pakistan and Turkey – are better placed than Bangladesh is, according to the senior BGMEA official. Pakistan is already armed with backward linkage while Vietnam and Cambodia bring goods by road from China, he explained. But it takes at least 15 days for the goods to reach Bangladesh by ship. The garment sector in Bangladesh has around 1,700 companies connected to the backward linkage. All of them produce buttons, zipper, colour and other accessories by using their own capacity with the raw materials imported from China. The backward linkage products are the worst hit by the coronavirus crisis in China, said Ocean Accessories Managing Director Mir Abdus Sattar Molla. There are around 37 products in this sector, 34 of which are imported directly from China. Only 4 or 5 products like carton, polybag needed for packaging have their raw materials imported from the countries other than China. Prices of the accessories have already shot up 10 to 15 percent, he said. The crisis is not visible now, as most of the garment factories have a supply in hand needed for a month, Molla said. But the crisis will intensify if the situation in China does not become normal in a week, he added. “The sector will feel the main blow of the coronavirus crisis in China the next month. Though the ports will start operating, there could be a gridlock. Some of the factories in Bangladesh are already facing trouble. We’re still not sure when China will start their exports,” Convince Zipper Managing Director Rafez Alam Chowdhury told bdnews24.com. China accounts for 95 percent of the spectacles market. The traders in Bangladesh import eyeglasses only from China due to their low costs. Eyeglasses are an emergency product which is solely dependent on China, said Bangladesh Spectacle Industry Traders Association President Sanaullah Khan. “The import has remained suspended since Jan 10. We’re trying to contact them almost every day. We’re not sure when the import will resume. Mostly, the eyeglasses are imported from Guangzhou and Shanghai,” Khan said. The spectacle industry is not affected now but it will face a crisis in two months, he said. “It takes two months to produce a product after the order is placed and another month for shipment. It may take four months to resume the spectacle import.” Almost all of the electronic motor pumps in the country are imported from China, said Nasiruddin from Shifang Machine House in Nababpur. But the sector will not face any problem in the coming months, he said. Import of all big and small machines, water pumps, electric motors and other machinery are depended on China, Bangladesh Electrical Motor Pump Importers Association Secretary Shahidul Islam Shopon told bdnews24.com. “The market should not be affected if the import is halted for a month, but keeping products can prove a big problem as they can’t be stored for long,” he added. “The importers have stocked up on some products due to the New Year holiday in China. That’s why prices have not shot up yet. But the market will be affected by the end of March.” A market worth Tk 250 billion has developed in Nababpur based on the Chinese machinery, Shahidul Alam Shopon said. “South Korea or Taiwan won’t be able to produce these products at such a low price.” Most of the raw materials needed to make batteries are available in the country, but the factories depend on China for 10 percent of raw materials, including plastic globules, said ATM Mostafa, proprietor of Abdullah Battery. “It will not be affected for the next one month but Bangladesh has to look for an alternative market if the crisis lingers,” he said. Pears, oranges, apples and grapes are imported from China, said Fresh Fruit Importers Association Treasurer Shamsul Haque. But the fruit market will not be affected much as there is an alternative market for those fruits, he said. A big supply of ginger and garlic comes from China, said Abdul Majed, a trader in Shyambazar. But there is nothing to worry about as an alternative market for the produce is available, he said."
Bangladeshi among new cases of coronavirus in UAE,22 February 2020 09:24 AM,"Two more residents of the UAE have tested positive for coronavirus, the UAE Ministry of Health and Prevention said on Friday.","This brings the total number of patients tested positive for COVID19 in the UAE to 11, three of whom have now recovered fully, the Gulf News reports. The two patients are: a 34-year-old resident from Philippines and a 39-year-old from Bangladesh. They were in direct contact with the Chinese patient recently diagnosed with coronavirus and are now in a stable health condition, the ministry said. Neither of the patients was named. The ministry affirmed that all people in direct contact with the coronavirus patients are being checked to ensure the safety of the community and that the disease will not break out in the country. The ministry emphasised that it is taking all necessary and precautionary measures, including investigating, examining and following up on those who were in contact with the patients, in cooperation with health authorities in the country. The ministry urged the public to follow the preventive procedures and to read the virus-awareness instructions, available on its website and the official websites of health authorities in the UAE. “The public are also advised to adopt protective health behaviours to avoid infectious diseases, including washing hands with soap and clean water, and covering the mouth when coughing or sneezing to stop the spread of germs and viruses,” the ministry said."
Needless panic about coronavirus will cause more trouble: IEDCR,22 February 2020 05:55 PM,"Pointless panic about the novel coronavirus will hinder efforts to prevent the disease, according to the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research or IEDCR.","Rumours should not be spread on the issue, IEDCR Director Prof Meerjady Sabrina Flora said at a media briefing on Saturday. Foreign nationals or Bangladesh returnees from abroad are being harassed, she said. “Some overenthusiastic people are creating embarrassing situations. We were informed that house owners are not letting their tenants enter the houses. A Chinese national was not allowed to enter his rented house and had to spend the night in a hotel,” she said.  Prof Meerjady Sabrina Flora, the director of IEDCR, briefs the media on Tuesday on the health condition of Bangladeshis evacuated from China amid the new coronavirus outbreak. Photo: Mahmud Zaman Ovi  “We have said the China returnees should remain at home. We’ll put the entire country at risk by not allowing them to enter their apartments. Now, if anyone has the symptoms of the disease, they’ll conceal it fearing the social stigma.” In Bangladesh, 77 people were checked for coronavirus infections but none of them tested positive, said the IEDCR director. The conditions of the five Bangladeshi nationals infected with the coronavirus in Singapore remain the same, she said. One of them is in critical condition, but the health authorities still hope for his recovery, she added. “They’re trying their best. We hope everyone will recover and go home.” Another Bangladeshi has been infected with the novel coronavirus in the United Arab Emirates, the health ministry of UAE said. Globally, 77,000 people have been infected with the virus as of Friday while the death toll rose to 2,360."
FBCCI urges banks to be flexible as coronavirus outbreak hits Bangladesh imports,22 February 2020 10:33 PM,The country's apex trade body has urged banks to exercise more flexibility while highlighting the negative impact of China's coronavirus outbreak on the supply chain of imported raw materials and products for local businesses.,"Speaking at a media briefing on Saturday, Sheikh Fazle Fahim, the president of Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industry or FBCCI, said traders, who have already opened LCs to import products from China, are facing shipping and customs clearance delays. ""The disruption to imports for the last month has created fears of bank payments becoming overdue. Under the circumstances, special measures are required in terms of credit assistance and loan repayment schemes to ensure that trade flow is not hindered in any way."" When an LC is opened for importing goods, banks set a deadline for the repayment of the credit and if the LC holder fails to meet the deadline, the payment becomes overdue. In such cases, banks impose stricter conditions making it difficult to open another LC in future. Since its outbreak in China's Hubei province in December last year, the novel coronavirus has killed 2,345 people and infected more than 77,000 people in the country. The virus has since spread to over 30 countries around the world with the world's second largest economy, China, taking a big hit. Bangladesh imported 672,000 tonnes of goods from China in January this year compared to 851,000 tonnes at the same time last year, marking a 21 percent drop, according to the FBCCI. Fahim urged banks not to impose additional charges or penalty interest if an LC holder informs them that they will not be able to submit the necessary paperwork on time due to shipment delays. He also called on banks to provide short-term loans to LC holders if they have an opportunity to import materials from alternative sources in case of shipment delay or failure."
"Singapore to donate $10,000 to family of coronavirus-infected Bangladeshi migrant worker",24 February 2020 12:44 PM,"The Migrant Workers' Centre or MWC in Singapore is sending a $10,000 donation via telegraphic bank transfer to the family of a 39-year-old Bangladeshi worker who tested positive for the coronavirus on Feb 8, reports The Straits Times.","The donation comprises contributions from the worker's employer Yi-Ke Innovations, Leo dormitory operator Mini-Environment Services and the MWC. The worker, who was staying at The Leo dormitory in Kaki Bukit, became Singapore's 42nd case of the virus. In a Facebook post on Monday, the MWC said it has been ""a distressing period of time for his family as he is the sole breadwinner"". The centre had contacted his next of kin through his employer soon after he was hospitalised, and has been providing the family with updates on his condition. ""We hope that the timely updates could offer them some comfort and solace during this period of time,"" the MWC added. The $10,000 assistance package is meant to help the worker's family take care of urgent purchases or payments associated with day-to-day expenses or other financial needs, the centre said. The Government will bear the cost of the worker's medical treatment during his stay in hospital. Four other Bangladeshi workers have been infected with the coronavirus. The MWC said it has been receiving offers of donations to help migrant workers who are hospitalised. It assured the public that the workers' welfare is ""being taken care of and they will receive the necessary help and assistance"". ""In the event that their condition takes a turn for the worse, the MWC may decide to hold a public fund-raising,"" it added."
Singapore's Bangladeshi workers have eyes on home as coronavirus shakes community,25 February 2020 12:43 PM,"With his shaggy grey beard, rose-coloured robe and a prayer cap that extends his tall frame, shopkeeper Tariqul Islam is an imposing figure on the stall-lined street that serves up home comforts to Singapore's Bangladeshi community.","He stands out even more now many of his customers have left the country or been told to avoid crowds after a coronavirus outbreak infected some Bangladeshi construction workers, thinning out the normally bustling thoroughfare. Unease over the virus has gripped groups of migrant workers across Asia - who often live in crowded, cramped conditions - and their families thousands of miles away who want them to return home. ""A lot of people have gone back,"" said Islam, 52, as a few customers wearing masks perused the fruit and vegetables spread outside his shop on Lembu Road in Singapore's Little India neighbourhood. ""When people think about life or family, they don't care about money.""  Migrant workers mostly from Bangladesh queue to collect free masks and get their temperatures taken in Singapore on Feb 23, 2020. REUTERS  Singapore has reported 90 coronavirus cases, five involving Bangladeshis who worked at the same construction site. One is in a ""very critical condition,"" Bangladesh's foreign minister said. A Bangladeshi in the United Arab Emirates has also been infected, as have Filipino and Indonesian domestic workers in Singapore and Hong Kong. In Singapore, construction workers from South Asia often live in 12-bed dormitories with shared bathrooms. Some of the high-profile virus clusters during the outbreak have involved people living close together, such as in prisons or aboard cruise ships. The virus, SARS-CoV-2, has killed more than 2,600 in China, where it first surfaced late last year. Kakon Miyan, a 24-year-old construction worker in Singapore, said a lot of his friends had returned to Bangladesh, where there have been no reported cases of the virus, and will only come back when the city-state appears clear. ""We're staying for now, but maybe if the situation worsens then we will go back too,"" he said, speaking in Bengali alongside a few colleagues. Bangladesh's high commission in Singapore said it has been trying to stop people from leaving by contacting them online and visiting dormitories to hand out masks, hand sanitiser and leaflets about the virus printed in their native language. ""We are becoming a bit proactive to stop them leaving the country... to assure them that this is not something we should be excessively or illogically fearful about,"" High Commissioner Mustafizur Rahman told Reuters.  Migrant workers mostly from Bangladesh shop for groceries on their day off in Singapore on Feb 23, 2020. REUTERS  There are around 150,000 Bangladeshis in the city-state, according to the high commission's website, making them one of its largest immigrant populations. HIGH STAKES Bangladeshis can become heavily indebted when they set off to find work Singapore, with some forced to pay agency fees equivalent to many months of their basic wages in Singapore. That raises the stakes for those considering leaving. Majidul Haq, 25, a construction worker who came back to Singapore on Monday after a one-month break in Bangladesh, said that his parents didn't want him to return but that he felt compelled because of his family's financial needs. ""My income is crucial,"" said Haq, whose father, a farmer, does not earn enough to support his six-member family, several of whom are still in school. Other workers said Singapore's high-quality healthcare facilities and preventative measures, such as taking employees' temperatures twice daily and isolating suspected cases, gave them confidence to stay. Rauf Naushard, who runs a travel agency just off Lembu Road that mainly serves Bangladeshi workers, said bookings have risen more than 50% over the last 14 days, with some customers requesting flights to Bangladesh's capital, Dhaka, with just a day's notice. ""It never happened before. They had travel plans before. Nowadays... they just want to leave,"" said Naushard, adding that many direct flights to Dhaka are full, so he must route trips through Bangkok or Kuala Lumpur."
Spread of virus could hasten the great coming apart of globalisation,26 February 2020 07:26 PM,"Globalisation, that awkward catchall for our interconnectedness, was already under assault from populists, terrorists, trade warriors and climate activists, having become an easy target for much that ails us.","Now comes the coronavirus. Its spread, analysts and experts say, may be a decisive moment in the fervid debates over how much the world integrates or separates. Even before the virus arrived in Europe, climate change, security concerns and complaints about unfair trade had intensified anxieties about global air travel and globalised industrial supply chains, as well as reinforcing doubts about the reliability of China as a partner. The virus already has dealt another blow to slowing economies, and emboldened populists to revive calls — tinged with racism and xenophobia — for tougher controls over migrants, tourists and even multinational corporations. Among all the challenges to globalisation, many of them political or ideological, this virus may be different. “We always forget that we’re at the mercy of nature, and when episodes pass we forget and carry on,” said Ivan Vejvoda, a fellow at the Institute for Human Sciences in Vienna. “But this virus has put forward all these questions about the interconnectedness of the world as we’ve built it. Air travel, global supply chains — it’s all linked.” As the virus spreads to Europe and beyond, Vejvoda said, “it makes China seem a bit more fragile and dependence on China as ‘the factory of the world’ more iffy.” The rapid spread of the virus from Asia is “another straw on the camel’s back of globalisation,” said Robin Niblett, director of Chatham House, the London research institution. The political tensions between the United States and China over trade, and as well as concerns about climate change, already had raised questions about the sense and cost of shipping parts country to country and the potential for carbon taxes at borders, he noted. Coupled with the risk of a supply chain that is vulnerable to the breakout of the next coronavirus, or the vulnerabilities of an increasingly authoritarian China, Niblett said, “If you’re a business you have to think twice about exposing yourself.” Particularly now, with more countries using sanctions and economic interdependence “as a new form of coercive diplomacy, and it adds up to becoming more risk-averse toward globalisation,” he said.  People in masks walk past closed shops in Milan on Feb. 23, 2020. The spread of the deadly epidemic to Europe’s fourth-largest economy has heightened fears of disruption in the global supply chain. (Andrea Mantovani for/The New York Times)  “What’s different is that with the airplane things can spread very fast,” he said. The immediate impulse is to recoil and erect barriers. “We already see flight numbers down dramatically.” Climate-conscious citizens were already discouraging discretionary air travel, as were digital technologies that allow remote participation and transmission of information. “You wonder if perhaps the peak of the global aircraft boom has passed,” Wolff said. “Many people are asking if we really need to have that kind of regular daily travel by air to all parts of the world.” In a way, this virus underscores the imbalance in globalisation. Private-sector supply chains have become very effective. Air travel is comprehensive and never ending. So the private sector is constantly moving around the world. But any sort of coordinated governmental response is often weak and disorganised — whether on climate change, health or trade. And efforts to strengthen globalised public efforts are attacked by nationalists and populists as infringements on sovereignty. Nor can governments do much to unfreeze supply chains, and few governments in Europe have the financial flexibility to inject much extra money into the economy. Theresa Fallon, director of the Center for Russia Europe Asia Studies, agreed that much of the pushback may now be directed at China. She recently returned from Milan, where officials are checking temperatures of travellers, doctors are careful about office visits and locals were visibly keeping their distance from Chinese tourists, she said. “China’s growth has been a long, positive story but now gravity has hit,” she said, with the virus arising as “a kind of black swan that underlines how different China is.” Many companies “are rethinking about putting too many eggs in the Chinese basket,” she said, especially as hopes of China becoming more like the West are fading. “We see more centralisation and lack of trust in China,” in its statistics and its ability to manage the crisis, she said. That was so even as Chinese leaders try to influence what they call “discourse management” with international institutions like the World Health Organization, in attempts to downplay the epidemic. That crisis of confidence in China extends beyond China’s ability to handle the virus, said Simon Tilford, director of the Forum New Economy, a research institution in Berlin. The lack of trust “will only reinforce an existing trend among businesses to reduce their dependency and risk,” he said. But the spread of the virus to Europe will also have a significant impact on politics, likely boosting the anti-immigrant, anti-globalisation far right, Tilford said. “We already see a lot of populist concern about the merits of globalisation as benefiting multinationals, the elite and foreigners, not local people and local companies,” he said. Politicians who insist on control over borders and immigration will be helped, even as the virus transcends borders easily. “Their argument will be that the current system poses not only economic but also health and security threats, which are existential, and that we can’t afford to be so open just to please big business,” Tilford said. That argument may attract voters “who hate overt racism but fear loss of control and a system vulnerable to a distant part of the world,” he added. The racial impact of the spreading virus is delicate, all agreed, but there. “It’s always different when it happens in your own neighborhood, among people like yourself,” said Stefano Stefanini, a former Italian diplomat. “When it happens in Denmark or Spain or Italy you have more of a feeling that it happens among people who share the same lifestyle — so you can see it happening to you.” But the virus also allows people to express hostility to the Chinese that they may have felt but had been reluctant to articulate, Tilford said. “There is already an undercurrent of fear of the Chinese in Europe and the United States because they represent a challenge to Western hegemony,” he said. That fear is being stoked by the Trump administration’s campaign against Huawei, China’s telecommunications company, but also by reports of Chinese repression and censorship through the use of advanced technology. Many Chinese living or traveling in the West have reported a quick spike in abuse and avoidance in public places and transport. “It’s a sign of how close to the surface these sentiments are,” Tilford said. The media, too, shares this sense of cultural distance and difference, Stefanini and Tilford said. Stefanini recalled debates in the Italian Foreign Ministry about whether to send condolence messages, depending on the numbers of deaths and how far away they occurred. “Events in Australia get massive coverage, but mass floods and deaths in Bangladesh barely register,” Tilford said. The outbreak in China “feels distant geographically and culturally, with a touch of racism, as if we measure lives lost in a different way,” he said. Italian sociologist Ilvo Diamanti had a more philosophical concern. The spread of the virus to Italy “has called into question our certainties,” because “it makes defence systems in the face of threats to our security more complicated, if not unnecessary,” he wrote in Monday’s La Repubblica. “The world no longer has borders that cannot be penetrated.” To defend against the virus, Diamanti wrote, “one would have to defend oneself from the world,” hiding at home and turning off the television, the radio and the internet. “In order not to die contaminated by others and become spreaders of the virus ourselves, we would have to die alone.” This, he suggested, is “a greater risk than the coronavirus.” c.2020 The New York Times Company"
Bangladesh designs three-level alert system to stop coronavirus outbreak,26 February 2020 11:15 PM,The authorities have designed a three-level alert system to prevent a possible coronavirus outbreak in Bangladesh as the new virus called COVID-19 has spread to 39 countries and regions from China.,"The Ministry of Health, the Directorate General of Health Services and the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research or IEDCR have jointly drafted the system. IEDCR Director Meerjady Sabrina Flora said on Wednesday that the first will be an initial alert level when no coronavirus case is reported. “We are currently undergoing this level,” she said. The authorities will switch to the second level if some people infected with COVID-19 come from abroad, Flora said. The next level will be in place if the number of coronavirus cases increases, the chief of the government’s disease control agency said. “We have not left any loopholes in the measures to prevent the virus. We hope no such situation will arise in Bangladesh,” she said. “We believe that the disease will not spread quickly [if it reaches Bangladesh] as we are taking integrated measures,” Flora said. The authorities also have sufficient kits for coronavirus tests, she said. Flora said no one of the 312 Bangladeshis evacuated from China’s Wuhan showed symptoms in the 10 additional days of observation, which ended on Tuesday, following a 14-day quarantine. The condition of five Bangladeshi coronavirus patients in Singapore and another in the UAE remains unchanged, she said. Besides China, infections have been reported in Italy, Iran, South Korea, Afghanistan, and Oman, Flora said. “We are keeping in touch with the Bangladeshis in Singapore, Iran, South Korea and Italy considering the current situation in those countries, she said. The IEDCR director requested all to be careful and get screened while travelling to or from the countries hit by the virus."

H&M sees no big delays in supply yet due to virus outbreak,28 February 2020 01:38 AM,"H&M, the world's second-biggest fashion retailer, said on Thursday it was still not seeing any major delays in supply due to the coronavirus outbreak.","The Swedish group sources most of its products in China and other Asian countries, such as Bangladesh and Cambodia.Primark owner Associated British Foods warned on Monday there was a risk of shortages of some clothing lines this year if delays in Chinese production were prolonged because of the virus.""We currently don't see that the virus leads to any larger delays with regards to supply,"" an H&M spokeswoman said.H&M does not make clothes itself but buys from a broad network of suppliers which gives it flexibility to purchase more from outside China. However, many Asian garment factories source supplies, such as fabric and yarn, from China.H&M has been gradually reopening its stores in China after closing around a third of them this month due to the outbreak. It said on Thursday that only 135 of 518 now remained closed in its fifth biggest market.Luxury handbag maker Hermes said on Wednesday just four of 43 stores in China remained closed, having closed 15 due to the outbreak.

"IUB holds seminar, campaigns to raise awareness about coronavirus",28 February 2020 04:38 AM,"The Independent University, Bangladesh or IUB has organised a seminar kicking off a month-long campaign to raise awareness about coronavirus.","The COVID-19 virus has spread worldwide and killed nearly 2,800 people, mostly in the heart of the outbreak in China. No one in Bangladesh has contracted the new virus, but at least six expatriates staying in Singapore and the UAE have tested positive. The authorities have taken measures to prevent a possible outbreak considering that the virus is reaching new countries and regions. The IUB School of Environmental Science and Management or SESM and the School of Life Sciences or SLS co-organised the seminar on the virus in Dhaka on Wednesday, the university said in a statement.Dhaka North Mayor Atiqul Islam, who took oath on Thursday after his recent re-election, was chief guest. He advised the university to introduce internships with the city corporation and assured cooperation to make the city free from coronavirus and mosquito-borne dengue. Professor Shah M Faruque, the dean in-charge of SLS, presented the keynote. He stated that coronavirus has now become “the biggest threat” to humankind as its cure and vaccination have not been discovered yet. Therefore, only the awareness and preventing the deadly disease can save lives, he pointed out.He demonstrated the causes of coronavirus, its symptoms and prevention methodology. Additional Director General of Health Services Sanya Tahmina, IUB Board of Trustees Chairman A Matin Chowdhury, Acting Vice-Chancellor Prof Milan Pagon, and SESM Dean Md Abdul Khaleque also spoke in the programme.

"Asia's garment industry sees lay-offs, factories closing due to coronavirus",29 February 2020 12:17 PM,Temporary factory closures and layoffs have already begun to hit low wage workers across Asia as quarantines and travel restrictions from the new coronavirus disrupt supply chains linked to China.,"For 31-year-old Myanmar worker Aye Su Than, the suspension of production at Hunter Myanmar, which produces clothes for an Italian fashion brand, came out of the blue when managers informed its 900 employees almost two weeks ago. ""They said, 'There are no orders, no buyers, because of the virus we are going to shut down,'"" said Aye Su Than, who is five months pregnant and makes about $130 per month. She said she got $320 in compensation from the factory, which declined to comment when contacted. ""We don't know what to do now… It is not easy to apply for a job elsewhere during my pregnancy,"" Aye Su Than said, sitting in a tea shop in Hlaing Tharyar, an industrial district on the outskirts of Yangon. Such bad news is being repeated in many parts of Asia's more than $290 billion textile industry, which accounted for 60% of the world's readymade garments, textiles and footwear in 2015, according to World Trade Organisation statistics. Low-wage workers are particularly vulnerable to any global economic downturn triggered by travel restrictions and quarantines as the coronavirus outbreak spreads from China around the world, roiling supply chains. International brands from Uniqlo to Adidas have wide networks of suppliers and can potentially shift production outside China to fill the potential gap in production from that country - the world's largest apparel and textile manufacturer. Still, sourcing lines in the clothing industry are deeply intertwined and factories in southeast Asia are dependent in turn on China for supplies like cloth, buttons and zippers. Cambodia said this week that 10 factories had already applied to suspend operations and would pay partial wages to about 3,000 workers.  Labourers produce protective masks at the Garment 10 company in Hanoi, Vietnam Feb 5, 2020. REUTERS  In Bangladesh, the world’s second-largest garment manufacturing industry after China, factories are still running but anxiety is growing. ""Nobody knows what will happen ahead but the factory owners are really worried,"" said Mohammed Nasir, a director of the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association. DEPENDENCE ON CHINA Readymade garments are a mainstay of Bangladesh's economy, contributing almost 16% of national output and about $34 billion worth of exports in the last fiscal year ending in June 2019. ""Almost 70% of our woven fabrics come from China and naturally if goods do not arrive on time, the readymade garments industry will be affected. If the crisis in China is prolonged, the impact would be severe,"" Nasir said. Bangladesh has about 4,000 garment factories employing some 4 million workers. Neighbouring Myanmar has a smaller industry but is more dependent on China, with the Myanmar Garment Manufacturers Association warning that half of the nation’s 500 factories could shut down by March if the crisis persists. China supplies about 90% of fabrics sent to Myanmar, which so far has not reported any cases of the virus, but the closure of the land border to try to keep infections out has disrupted the supply chain. ""We can still export, but we cannot say what is going to happen in the next one or two months,"" Aung Min, vice-chairman of the manufacturers' association, told Reuters. ""This is kind of scary – the situation is uncertain."" A prolonged crisis could eventually see retailers face a shortage of clothing, although fashion giant H&M Group said it currently doesn’t see the virus causing any larger delays in deliveries. ""We are in close contact with our suppliers in China and evaluating the situation together with them on a daily basis,"" H&M spokeswoman Ulrika Isaksson said, adding that the company was also exploring other options for production. Manufacturers, too, are scrambling to find alternative suppliers of everything from fabric to buttons and zippers. ""It is not easy to shift the sourcing destination overnight. But buyers are currently looking for alternative sources,"" said Siddiqur Rahman, a leading garment exporter. Alternative raw material suppliers are being explored in Thailand, Indonesia, Pakistan and India but then costs will go up, he said. ""Are the buyers ready to pay more? I don't think so. So, it is not that easy. But we’ll have to look beyond China to survive in the long run,"" said Rahman."
Two Bangladeshi nationals recover from coronavirus in Singapore,29 February 2020 04:38 PM,Two Bangladeshi nationals have recovered from bouts with the novel coronavirus in Singapore.,"But the government's disease control agency, IEDCR, advised greater caution while pointing out that the chances of contracting the deadly virus outside China are now greater than ever. Briefing the media on Saturday, IEDCR Director Dr Meerjady Sabrina Flora said, ""It's good news for us that a Bangladeshi who was suffering from the coronavirus infection in Singapore has gone home after making a recovery."" Five Bangladeshis have tested positive for the virus which originated in China's Wuhan before spreading to over 50 countries around the world. One of the Bangladeshi patients, however, remains in critical condition in the South-East Asian country. ""Another Bangladeshi was released from hospital in Singapore the day before. But the man condition of the man who was in a critical state, remains the same,"" said Flora. ""The rest are in stable condition and could be discharged from hospital at any time."" While the number of new cases has gone down in mainland China, excluding the Hubei province, daily infections have surged in Italy, South Korea and Iran, which has become the epicentre of the virus in the Middle East. A Bangladeshi migrant has also been infected with the virus in the United Arab Emirates. Health officials in Bangladesh ran tests on 87 people in the last 24 hours but the country is yet to detect a case of the novel virus, according to Flora. ""We are ready to combat any situation and are continuing the screening measures."""
IEDCR suggests home quarantine for returnees from countries with coronavirus cases,01 March 2020 04:26 PM,"The Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research has suggested people returning from countries having coronavirus infection cases to quarantine themselves at home even if they do not show any symptom.","The IEDCR made the call in an effort to avoid the spread of Covid-19 infections in Bangladesh as it spread in more than 50 countries. “No case of coronavirus infection has been identified in Bangladesh as of now. If the virus ever enters Bangladesh, it will be through the people travelling in those countries,” IEDCR Director Meerjady Sabrina Flora said at a media briefing in Dhaka on Sunday. “Therefore, the returnees must remain in a home quarantine for some days and should not come out unless it is badly needed,” she said. Bangladesh tested the blood samples of 88 people but did not find any case of infection. The IEDCR nevertheless asked people to remain cautious as the pathogen has spread quickly. “We suggest that those who return home from abroad should use masks for going home from the airport. If possible, they should use private transports. They should keep the windows open,” said Flora. “We earnestly request you to remain at home and avoid crowded areas. Use a mask if you have to go out.” The authorities are prepared to identify any infected person through screening and provide treatment at the airport, according to the IEDCR director. Flora suggested contacting the IEDCR via its hotline in case of anyone coming from abroad with symptoms. The IEDCR called for the Bangladeshi nationals to avoid the countries that reported coronavirus cases. Five Bangladeshi migrant workers were infected with the virus in Singapore: two have been discharged from the hospital and another two will be released soon, Flora said. The fifth is still in intensive care in the city state. Another Bangladeshi national was infected in the United Arab Emirates."
"IEDCR advises against handshakes, hugs as coronavirus spreads further",03 March 2020 05:01 AM,"The government’s disease control agency IEDCR has urged all not to panic over coronavirus, saying  it is possible to reduce the risk of infection by changing habits and hygiene practices.","Meerjady Sabrina Flora, the director of the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research asked everyone to be careful about the disease while elaborating the latest condition during a regular media briefing organised at the institute in Dhaka on Monday. “The Health Directorate alone cannot prevent a coronavirus outbreak. Every citizen has responsibility. If we perform our job from our respective positionbthen it will be possible to prevent the spread of the virus,” Flora said. The IEDCR director suggested washing hands with soap regularly and following cough etiquette to keep the virus away. “It will be possible for you to prevent coronavirus and other respiratory diseases if you avoid handshakes, hugs and similar formalities that force you to come within a metre of another person,” she said. LOCAL-LEVEL COMMITTEES FORMED The government has formed committees at the local levels to prevent a possible coronavirus outbreak.   The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has constituted separate committee chaired by deputy commissioners and Upazila executive officers. They issued the order to inform the officials about the committees on Monday. The committees will implement the directives of a national panel on coronavirus outbreak prevention by taking the necessary steps to raise public awareness. They will also take necessary measures for financial and logistic support along with quarantine facilities if needed, the order said.   Superintendents of police, Upazila council chairmen, municipality mayors, livestock officers, education officers, information officers, relief and rehabilitation officers, deputy directors of the Department of Social Services and civil surgeons will work as members of the district-level committees.The local MPs and district council chairmen will act as advisors.At the Upazila level, the committees will have the OCs of police stations, health and family planning officers, municipality mayors, livestock officers, education officers, secondary education officers, project implementation officers and social services officers as members.The new coronavirus has spread to more than 50 countries from China with nearly 90,000 cases, including 3,000 fatal ones.

Bangladeshi doctor urges China to allow her to serve coronavirus patients in Wuhan,05 March 2020 01:17 AM,A Bangladeshi doctor has urged the Chinese government to allow her access to the locked-down Wuhan city so that she can serve coronavirus patients at the epicentre of a global outbreak.,"Syeda Zerin Imam, a doctoral student of Shandong University in China’s Jinan province, who is currently in Bangladesh, had recently handed a letter to the Chinese embassy expressing her intent.

Three sailors kept in ‘isolation’ in Mongla for coronavirus screening,05 March 2020 04:53 PM,Three sailors of a ship that reached the Mongla port have been taken into the isolation ward for having body temperature more than the normal range amid the global outbreak of the coronavirus.,"The authorities have stopped the offloading of goods from the Serenitas N, a bulk carrier sailing under the flag of the Marshal Islands, said Mongla Port’s harbour master Fakharuddin Ahmed. The Serenitas N sailed from the Lianyungang port in China to the Mongla port via Chattogram port carrying 24,000 tonnes of coal on Wednesday. A five-member medical team of the port entered the ship for medical check-ups of the sailors, said Samir Asif, a physician in the port hospital. Of the 20 sailors, three Filipinos were found with body temperature crossing the normal range. They were taken into the isolation ward for further medical screening. Though the sailors have high body temperature, they did not show other symptoms common to coronavirus patients, Asif told bdnews24.com. The port authority banned the other sailors from getting off the ship, said Fakharuddin. In Bangladesh, the infection cases can be tested only in the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research or IEDCR. “We have been contacting the authority since last night. But the ship is docked quite far away from the port. It is hard to reach there. That’s why it is taking some time. We’ll disseminate the information the moment we receive it,” IEDCR Director Meerjady Sabrina Flora said on Thursday. The Mongla port took precautionary measures following the global outbreak of the coronavirus. The virus has killed at least 3,283 people worldwide, mostly in China, where the epidemic originated in December."
"As India coronavirus cases spike, experts daunted by prospect of South Asia spread",05 March 2020 07:14 PM,India has ramped up the screening of travellers to keep the coronavirus at bay but a flurry of new cases has experts warning that it may be hard to contain a spread in densely populated South Asia with its generally poor medical infrastructure.,"India, Pakistan and Bangladesh are home to some 1.7 billion people, or more than a fifth of the world's population, but their over-stretched health systems could struggle to handle the type of intensive care required for coronavirus patients. On top of that, a prevalence of existing health problems such as diabetes could spell trouble while the sort of sweeping restrictions China has imposed to stifle the virus would be hugely difficult in South Asia's more unruly cities. ""The way Indian society is structured, the kind of lockdown that many countries including China and Japan have instituted, is pretty much impossible even under good circumstances,"" said Vivekanand Jha, executive director of the George Institute for Public Health, in New Delhi. India's total confirmed coronavirus rose to 29 on Wednesday, from six early this week. The coronavirus, which emerged in China late last year, has infected more than 95,000 people globally, and killed more than 3,200, most of them in China. Some health experts fear that even with the recent spike in cases, India's actual tally could be much bigger. ""There is a strong possibility that the number of cases in India is much higher than what has been detected,"" Arunkumar G., director of the Manipal Institute of Virology, said, citing a virus incubation of up to two weeks. Fears were fanned this week when India's health minister disclosed that 16 foreign tourists who have tested positive had been touring since mid-February. Last week, US intelligence sources told Reuters that India's available countermeasures and the potential for the virus to spread its dense population was a focus of serious concern. 'ALL INITIATIVES' India's government says it has screened more than one million travellers, boosted its testing capabilities and set up isolation wards in all major cities with international airports. But 450 million of India's 1.3 billion people are estimated to be migrants, with vast numbers packing its rail and road systems daily meaning controlling any spread would be a huge challenge. India's high number of diabetics - 77 million - and high rates of problems like kidney disease could lead to higher morbidity, or protracted treatment, experts said. ""One particular risk of India is the co-existence of other non-communicable disease epidemics,"" Dr Rajib Dasgupta, who is a professor of community health at the Jawaharlal Nehru University in New Delhi. Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government says it is confident of its ability to arrest the spread of the virus. ""Coronavirus is a challenge, but the government of India has taken all initiatives to ensure that it is stopped,"" said DV Sadananda Gowda, minister of chemicals, who oversees the pharmaceuticals sector. Neighbouring Pakistan has found five coronavirus cases. A top health official was gloomy about the prospects of tackling a major outbreak. ""We don't have human resources, we don't have the required inventory, we don't have a capacity to cope with a big emergency with the given resources,"" Shahid Malik, secretary general of the Pakistan Medical Association, told Reuters. Bangladesh has not confirmed any cases of the coronavirus but five Bangladeshi workers have tested positive in Singapore. Bangladesh's health ministry said more than 300,000 people have been screened at airports and other border entry points. But one passenger was not impressed by what he considered lax screening upon arrival in the capital, Dhaka. ""Many of us could skip the screening. Just imagine what would happen if someone infected with the virus enters. It'll be a total disaster,"" Farid Yamin, a Bangladeshi working in Singapore, told Reuters."
Kuwait-bound Bangladeshi travellers in trouble over coronavirus health clearance,05 March 2020 08:36 PM,Kuwait-bound Bangladeshi travellers are finding themselves in trouble as the Middle-Eastern country has made clearance after coronavirus test mandatory to get visa.,"Uncertainty now looms over the journey of many of the passengers, who have received visa and booked tickets accordingly, due to bureaucratic complexities at Kuwait Embassy in Dhaka and the government’s disease control agency IEDCR, the lone body that conducts coronavirus test in Bangladesh. In a move aimed at controlling the rapid spread of the disease at home, Kuwait’s civil aviation authority said on Tuesday passengers from 10 nations, including Bangladesh, must produce certificates issued by the Kuwaiti embassy in their country saying they are coronavirus-free.    Hundreds of Bangladeshis, mostly migrant workers who returned home on holidays, demonstrated outside the IEDCR at Mohakhali on Thursday against its refusal to test and certify them.    At least 1,000 Bangladeshis travel to Kuwait daily by direct and indirect flights, according to the expatriates. Meerjady Sabrina Flora, the director at the IEDCR, said they had informed the health ministry about the issue.    “But giving certificates to the Kuwait-bound passengers is an administrative matter, not epidemiology. Our duty is to conduct surveillance and detect coronavirus patients. A person showing no symptoms does not need coronavirus test,” she added."
Coronavirus clearance for Bangladeshi passengers to Kuwait from Saturday,06 March 2020 12:10 AM,"Starting from Saturday, the authorities will start giving health clearance for the coronavirus to Bangladeshi passengers bound for Kuwait.","Abdul Kalam Azad, the head of the Directorate General of Health Services, announced the decision after a meeting of a national committee at the Institute of Public Health Nutrition in Dhaka. The travellers will undergo screening at the institute in the capital’s Mohakhali, he said. It was the first meeting of the committee on coordination of efforts to prevent a possible outbreak of COVID-19, an illness caused by the virus. “We will conduct their clinical examination and record their recent history. If they show no symptoms of coronavirus, we will give them the certificate,” Azad said. The travellers will need to show their passports and plane tickets and photocopies of the tickets for the screening, he said. In a move aimed at controlling the rapid spread of the disease at home, Kuwait’s civil aviation authority said on Tuesday passengers from 10 nations, including Bangladesh, must produce certificates issued by the Kuwaiti embassy in their country saying they are coronavirus-free. On Wednesday, the embassy handed all visa applicants a form for coronavirus test, but the IEDCR said it received no instructions on conducting the tests on people who do not show symptoms. Hundreds of Bangladeshis, mostly migrant workers who returned home on holidays, demonstrated outside the IEDCR at Mohakhali on Thursday against its refusal to test and certify them. One of them, Zahangir Hossain, told bdnews24.com he would suffer a loss of at least Tk 40,000 if his ticket is cancelled due to a delay in getting the certificate. At least 1,000 Bangladeshis travel to Kuwait daily by direct and indirect flights, according to the expatriates. Meerjady Sabrina Flora, the director at the IEDCR, said its duty was “to conduct surveillance and detect coronavirus patients”. “A person showing no symptoms does not need coronavirus test,” she added. She later attended the national committee meeting."
Bangladesh exporters panic as downtrend continues amid global coronavirus spread,06 March 2020 01:08 AM,"Bangladesh’s February export earnings have dropped to a little over $3.32 billion by 1.8 percent from the previous year, missing the target by 10.74 percent and spreading panic among businesses over the economic impact of the global coronavirus outbreak.","In July-February period, Bangladesh exported goods worth $26.24 billion, which is nearly 4.8 percent less the same period in the last fiscal year and 13 percent than the target, according to data published by the Export Promotion Bureau on Thursday.“We don’t know what to do. The situation is getting worse by the minute,” said Anwar-Ul-Alam Chowdhury Parvez, a former president of the readymade garment exporters’ body BGMEA. Apparel is the largest exporting sector of the country, contributing over 80 percent to total exports.“We had already been struggling in terms of global competitiveness. Now this coronavirus is destroying everything we have. We are very much panicked. There will be huge effects on exports in March as well,” he said.Parvez noted that the coronavirus has spread to almost everywhere, including Bangladesh’s biggest markets in the US and Europe, while the biggest supplier of raw materials, China, is at the heart of the outbreak.“I see darkness whenever I think about how I will pay the workers during the two next Eid festivals,” Parvez added. Faruque Hassan, a former vice-president of the association, said “We are watching the situation every hour and thinking about how horrible it may become.” “But it’s right we shouldn’t sit idly by. We must tackle the situation with whatever we have,” he added, calling for help from the government through steps like separate taka-dollar transaction rate for RMG sector and instant payment of cash incentives."
Kuwait suspends flights to and from seven countries over coronavirus,07 March 2020 11:55 AM,"Kuwait has suspended all flights to and from seven countries, including Bangladesh, for a week in a bid to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus in the country.","The other countries on the list are Egypt, Lebanon, Syria, Philippines, India, and Sri Lanka. The measures will take effect immediately, Kuwait's civil aviation directorate announced in a circular issued on Mar 6.Kuwait has also banned entry of anyone who has been in the seven countries in the last two weeks other than returning Kuwaiti nationals, who will have to submit to quarantine procedures, the aviation authority added.The move has forced Biman Bangladesh Airlines to cancel its scheduled flights to the Gulf state on March 6 and 10, the national flag carrier's Managing Director Md Mokabbir Hossain told bdnews24.com."
What is the test for coronavirus and how does it work?,07 March 2020 07:03 PM,"The outbreak of a novel coronavirus (COVID-19), originating in China's Hubei province, has set alarm bells ringing across the world with cases of the infection confirmed in over 50 countries.","Reports on the virus, which has sickened tens of thousands of people and killed more than 3,000 globally, are nearly ubiquitous on social media and news bulletins, triggering widespread panic among ordinary citizens. So what happens if you have a fever, cough and experience breathing difficulties? You might even go to a hospital with symptoms of pneumonia leading doctors to fear that you may have contracted the virus. But how can you know with certainty if you've really been infected with the novel coronavirus? Ideally, you will get yourself tested for the virus for confirmation. But what is the test for the virus and how is it conducted? IEDCR HOTLINE The IEDCR has opened a service for the public to report suspected coronavirus cases. Any person showing symptoms of COVID-19 and suspected to have contracted the coronavirus is requested to call IEDCR hotline numbers: 01927711784,  01927711785,  01937000011,  01937110011 THROAT SWAB Testing for COVID-19 is rather similar to that for the flu. First, a specimen will be collected to check for the virus. Health experts believe the coronavirus replicates in the respiratory tract, causing mild to moderate upper-respiratory tract illnesses, like the common cold. The World Health Organization (WHO) and the US Centres for Disease Control (CDC) therefore recommend deep throat swabs, going through both your mouth and your nose. You may also be asked to cough up sputum, a mixture of saliva and mucus. This procedure is being followed by specialists at the Bangladesh government's disease control agency, the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research or IEDCR.    ""We collect a sample of the potential patient's saliva or mucus from the nose. An examination of such a sample reveals if there is a coronavirus infection."" THE SPECIMEN WILL BE SENT TO A QUALIFIED LAB According to a report by CNN, citing the US testing procedure, once a sample has been collected, it must be stored in a sterile tube or vial as is the case with any other medical test. In order to preserve the specimen, it is first chilled before being shipped with an ice pack to a qualified lab with access to a coronavirus test kit. In Bangladesh, only the IEDCR has the facilities to conduct such a test. Laboratories are required to have a minimum biosafety level or BSL of 2 to run tests for Nipah or Influenza virus, said Alamgir. The IEDCR is equipped with both BSL-2 and BSL-3 facilities. ""Only one or two medical colleges in Bangladesh have such labs. But they don't have the capacity to conduct tests for the coronavirus. Even though they have the labs, they don't have an entomologist or a rapid response team,"" said Alamgir. RT-PCR TEST Once samples arrive at the lab, technicians use a procedure called RT-PCR, or reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, to look for the genetic code of the coronavirus using a special reagent.    The test kit is called the “Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Real-Time Reverse Transcriptase (RT)-PCR Diagnostic Panel"". The IEDCR is using test kits provided by the WHO called ""PCR Primary Probe Reagent"", according to Alamgir. A virus, just like any other species, has a unique genetic code called the viral genome. This code, called the viral genome, provides the blueprint for the virus as it replicates and the coronavirus test works by determining whether any given specimen contains the distinct coronavirus genome, according to the CNN report. Lab technicians first extract any genetic information from the throat swabs and sputum samples. The purified genetic material is then mixed with a set of ingredients, including some derived from the coronavirus itself, and the entire solution is placed into a testing machine, the report adds. The virus' genetic material will amplify if a patient's specimen contains the coronavirus and the machine will return a positive result. The IEDCR will send the specimen to the WHO which will then run a test to confirm the result. HOW LONG WILL THE TEST TAKE? According to Alamgir, it takes the IEDCR at least three hours to return a result for the test. ""A number of procedures have to be followed after the sample is brought in. First we have to extract the RNA before running it through the PCR machine. There are a few other steps after that so it takes us about three hours to complete the test."" But the entire process is dependent on receiving a sample. Each RT-PCR test costs more than Tk 5,000 but the government is currently bearing the expenses. ARE THERE ENOUGH TESTING KITS? At present, the IEDCR has about 1,500 test kits with more on the way, according to Alamgir. On whether these will be sufficient if the virus spreads in Bangladesh, he said that it won't be necessary to run tests on every potential patient should such a scenario transpire. ""We have surveillance measures in place throughout the country. So if anyone tests positive for the coronavirus, we will ask hospitals across the land to send the samples of every patient suffering from a cold or breathing trouble."" ""If any of the samples test positive for coronavirus, then we will know that the virus has begun spreading in the country. This is called community transmission.""    WHAT IS THE TREATMENT FOR CORONAVIRUS? Much like the common cold or flu, the coronavirus infection doesn't have any special treatment. Since a vaccine for the virus is yet to be developed, the only way to stay safe is by avoiding close contact with infected people. As there is currently no treatment or cure for the infection, hospitals in the UK are trying to relieve the symptoms while allowing the patient's immune system to fight the virus, according to the BBC. Patients with pneumonia are generally given oxygen and in the worst cases, they may be put on a ventilator. A strong immune system can help fight the virus naturally within a few days. According to the WHO, older persons and persons with pre-existing medical conditions (such as high blood pressure, heart disease, lung disease, cancer or diabetes) appear to develop serious illness more often than others."
Bangladesh may lose as much as $3bn to coronavirus outbreak in worst scenario: ADB,08 March 2020 02:42 AM,"Bangladesh may lose up to $3.021 billion if the ongoing coronavirus outbreak across the globe turns to the worst, the Asian Development Bank says.","The loss will be $8 million in the best scenario and $16 million, or 0.01 percent of the GDP, if it ends moderately, according to a new analysis by the ADB. The spread of the deadly virus will have a significant impact on developing Asian economies through numerous channels leading to sharp declines domestic demand, lower tourism and business travel, trade and production linkages, supply disruptions, and health effects, the Asian lender said on Friday. “The magnitude of the economic losses will depend on how the outbreak evolves, which remains highly uncertain,” it said. The range of scenarios explored in the analysis suggests a global impact in the range of $77 billion to $347 billion, or 0.1 percent to 0.4 percent of GDP. In a moderate scenario, where precautionary behaviours and restrictions such as travel bans start easing three months after the outbreak intensified and restrictions were imposed in late January, global losses could reach $156 billion, or 0.2 percrnt of global GDP, according to the analysis. China would account for $103 billion of those losses—or 0.8 percent of its GDP, the ADB said. The rest of developing Asia would lose $22 billion, or 0.2 percent of its GDP, it added. “There are many uncertainties about COVID-19, including its economic impact,” said ADB Chief Economist Yasuyuki Sawada. “This requires the use of multiple scenarios to provide a clearer picture of potential losses. We hope this analysis can support governments as they prepare clear and decisive responses to mitigate the human and economic impacts of this outbreak.” “ADB stands ready to provide further support to its developing members in their efforts to respond to the adverse impact of COVID-19. ADB will use appropriate means to address the identified needs including through existing and new financial assistance, emergency assistance lending, policy-based lending, private sector investment, and knowledge and technical assistance,” the Manila-based lender said in a statement."

She said the IEDCR was communicating with all the missions abroad to discuss the impact of the situation on the Bangladeshi expatriates and travellers. Speaking about the returnees, she said, “I urge the Bangladeshis who have come from abroad not to travel now if they show any symptoms. Please stay wherever you are. We will reach you if you contact the IEDCR.” Later, Health Officer Shahriar Sazzad at Shahjalal International Airport in Dhaka told bdnews24.com that they would isolate travellers from six countries if they showed any symptoms of coronavirus in temperature screening. The six countries are China, Italy, South Korea, Iran and Thailand. The suspected cases will be kept at the Kuwait Bangladesh Friendship Government Hospital, he said. He urged all the returnees from those six countries to isolate themselves for 14 days, the incubation period of the virus."
"Mujib Barsha big event postponed, large public gatherings avoided over coronavirus scare",08 March 2020 11:34 PM,The authorities have postponed the key event of Mar 17 at the National Parade Ground in Dhaka designed to officially launch the celebrations of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman’s birth centenary after Bangladesh recorded its first coronavirus cases.,"All large public gatherings will be avoided during the celebrations of the day, Kamal Abdul Naser Chowdhury, the chief coordinator of the national committee to implement the Mujib Barsha programmes, said at a news conference in the capital on Sunday. The decisions to limit the gatherings were taken in a meeting chaired by the committee’s chief and Bangabandhu’s daughter Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina at her Ganabhaban residence. The other daughter of Bangabandhu, Sheikh Rehana, was also present. “The decisions have been made to spare the people of sufferings as you know that public interest is the top priority of the prime minister,” Kamal said. The programmes of paying respects to the Father of the Nation at the Bangabandhu Memorial Museum in Dhanmondi 32 and his grave in Gopalganj’s Tungipara, however, will go ahead like every year, Kamal said. The nation was set to kick off the celebrations through a huge gathering at the National Parade Ground in Tejgaon on the 100th birth anniversary of the Father of the Nation. A countdown to the beginning of the celebrations has also been launched. But the spread of the coronavirus from China to almost 100 countries made uncertain the plan for grand celebrations as the authorities across the world have put harsh travel restrictions and cancelled public events to contain the outbreak. President Md Abdul Hamid, Hasina, her Indian counterpart Narendra Modi, and many other leaders from the region and beyond had been scheduled to attend the programme. Kamal said the event has been pushed back considering the health risks. He said small events on a limited scale will be organised to celebrate Bangabandhu’s birth centenary at the educational institutions and elsewhere, keeping the coronavirus situation across the globe in mind. Other programmes to kick off the celebrations included a 31-gun salute in Dhaka and other places at sunrise, and hoisting of the national flag at all government and non-government buildings. An event marking the National Children’s Day would be held in Tungipara, the birth place of Bangabandhu. Special prayers would also be held throughout the country. The health authorities earlier on Sunday confirmed Bangladesh’s first three cases of the coronavirus, which has infected more than 106,000 people and caused over 3,600 deaths across the world after originating in China by the end of last year."

BNP’s Fakhrul accuses govt of hiding coronavirus cases,09 March 2020 07:24 PM,BNP Secretary General Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir has accused the government of hiding information about coronavirus cases ahead of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman’s birth centenary celebrations.,"“The government was long silent on the coronavirus and the cases of infections were discovered only yesterday. I don’t know for sure but it seems the government disclosed the cases only after foreign delegates expressed unwillingness to visit Bangladesh at this moment,” Fakhrul alleged at an event in Dhaka on Monday.    “It seems to me that the cases were detected in Bangladesh much earlier but the government tried to hide the information,” he said. The government’s disease control agency confirmed first three coronavirus cases on Sunday: two of them returned from Italy and the third was from the family of one of the infected persons.

"No new coronavirus cases detected in last 24 hours, says IEDCR",09 March 2020 08:10 PM,The government's disease control agency has confirmed that no new cases of the novel coronavirus were detected in Bangladesh in the last 24 hours.,"The Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research's Director Meerjady Sabrina Flora made the disclosure at a media briefing on Monday. According to Flora, the IEDCR received 509 phone calls on its hotline in the last 24 hours since the country confirmed its first three cases of the infection Sunday. Among these, 489 calls were regarding the coronavirus, she said. ""We've tested the specimens of four people but we didn't detect the virus in any one of them. So that means the number of confirmed cases still stands at three."" The IEDCR on Sunday announced that three Bangladeshis -- two men and a woman -- had contracted the novel virus, the first confirmed cases in the country. Among them, the two men had recently returned from Italy, a country reeling from a severe outbreak of the virus. The woman is a relative of one of the returnees. Flora urged people returning from countries where the virus is prevalent to quarantine themselves at home for 14 days even if they do not show any symptom. Requesting the cooperation of relatives in this matter, she said: ""Relatives must also remain alert during these 14 days of home quarantine. If the potential patient leaves the house accidentally, he or she must be reminded of the quarantine."""

Man of Bangladesh-origin becomes third coronavirus fatality in the UK,10 March 2020 01:34 AM,"A Bangladesh-origin man in his 60s has become the third patient to die after testing positive for coronavirus in the UK, reports the BBC.","He passed away at a hospital in Manchester after recently returning from a trip to Italy -- Europe's coronavirus hotbed, according to NHS England. ""I am very sorry to report that a third patient in England who tested positive for Covid-19 has sadly died. I offer my sincere condolences to their family and friends and ask that their privacy is respected,"" The Guardian quotes England’s chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty as saying. “The patient, who was being treated at the North Manchester General Hospital, was over 60 years old and had significant underlying health conditions.They had recently travelled from an affected area. Contact tracing is already under way.” Speaking to BBC Bangla, the victim's son said he had been suffering from a combination of high cholestrol, arthritis, heart condition, ashthma and other respiratory problems. Even though he was not 100 percent healthy, the man had been in reasonably good health prior to his death, according to his son. But he died just five days after being diagnosed with the novel coronavirus infection. He migrated to Italy from Bangladesh in 1989 before settling in a town near the country's border with Switzerland, about 50km away from Milan. He moved to the UK about four or five years ago but would nevertheless visit Italy every year. This year, he made the trip to Italy in the middle of February before returning to Manchester on Feb 29. ""He was healthy when he got back but his condition deteriorated three days later,"" said his son. The man was rushed to the local health centre after he fell sick on Mar 3 and was kept in isolation after physicians were informed that he had recently visited Italy. He was later transferred to North Manchester General Hospital. ""He was doing quite well during his first few days in hospital.

Govt too busy with Mujib Year celebrations to deal with coronavirus: BNP's Rizvi,11 March 2020 04:45 PM,BNP Senior Joint Secretary General Ruhul Kabir Rizvi has accused the government of being too preoccupied with the birth centenary celebrations of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman to properly address the growing panic over a novel coronavirus.,"“The nation is gripped with panic over the coronavirus but the government is negligent and whimsical over the issue. Their entire focus is on celebrating Mujib Year,” Rizvi said in a media briefing on Wednesday. The Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research or IEDCR confirmed the first three cases of the coronavirus in Bangladesh on Sunday. Two of them had recently returned from Italy, while the other is a relative of one of the returnees.

A group of dishonest officials are selling ‘coronavirus-free certificates’ in the airport. The media already reported on it.” “That’s why those Italy returnees were not detected at the airport. The government shifted them to a hospital when they visited a doctor after their condition deteriorated. The wife of one of the returnees has also been infected with the coronavirus.” The BNP bemoaned the 'completely unsafe' state of airports and land ports while alleging that public hospitals lack adequate ICU beds and ventilation machines to treat infected patients. ""The airports don’t have scanners or have ones that are out of order. Three thermal scanners were installed in the international airport but they are broken already,” said Rizvi."

The coronavirus, which emerged in China's Hubei province in December, has spread to over 115 countries around the world, halting industry, bringing flights to a standstill, closing schools and forcing the postponement of sporting events and concerts. The outbreak was declared recently described as a pandemic by the World Health Organization. It has infected than 138,000 people globally and over 5,000 have died, according to a Reuters tally of government announcements. Millions are locked down in Italy -- the worst-affected country outside China -- where total number of infections have risen to 17,660 with 1,266 deaths. Bangladesh reported its first cases of the virus on Mar 8 after two men and a woman were diagnosed with the infection. Among them, two had recently returned to the country from Italy. But airport officials could not immediately confirm the number of returnees from Italy on Saturday. ""I don't know the exact figure yet. We were informed when the flight was departing from Dubai that there were 125 adults and a one-and-a-half-year old child. But we later found discrepancies in the number so there could be more,"" said Shahriar. MANDATORY QUARANTINE The health ministry later said the number of returnees was 142 and announced that Health Minister Zahid Malik has ordered all of them into a mandatory 14-day quarantine at Ashkona Hajj Camp. The compulsory quarantine measures will also apply to all travelers arriving in Bangladesh from any country affected by the coronavirus pandemic, the ministry said in a statement. Anyone violating the order could face a fine or jail time, it added. On the health of the evacuees from Italy, Meerjady Sabrina Flora, director of the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research or IEDCR, said none of them showed any symptoms of the coronavirus infection.""They underwent screening but none of them showed any signs of the virus. But we are working on gathering detailed information on them.""""If anyone is found to have any symptoms later, we will recommend self-quarantine for them. Those who have problems with that will be brought into institutional quarantine."""
Coronavirus alert: How effective is it?,14 March 2020 10:54 AM,Rezaul Karim is an autorickshaw driver working in Dhaka for one and a half decades. He pulled over beside a teashop at Segunbagicha on Friday afternoon to get some food.,"He said he had heard about the global spread of the coronavirus, which has infected three people in Bangladesh as well. “We are illiterate. We haven’t thought much about it,” he said when asked about the measures people should take to avoid catching the virus. Rezaul said he knows about the advice that people need to frequently wash their hands. “As you’ve seen now, I’ve eaten a cake without washing my hands. Where will I get soap and water in the street? I can’t do it even if I wish to. I will freshen up once I'm at home,” he said.   Like the rest of the world, people in Bangladesh are panicking and have wrong ideas about the spread of the virus. Experts emphasise cleanliness and personal hygiene to stop the coronavirus outbreak. Along with the government, conscious netizens are campaigning on social media while the mainstream media are publishing news to raise awareness. But most of the people bdnews24.com spoke with in Dhaka on Friday said they do not have a clear idea about what they should do in the time of the coronavirus.    Shafayet Ullah, a teacher at a school at Khilgaon, thinks the government should take effective measures besides raising awareness so that the people can maintain hygiene while travelling in the city. “The government can keep soaps and water at every corner so that the people can wash their hands,” he said. Experts say public transport, banknotes and helmets of ridesharing services can play a key role in spreading the virus.    “The situation is not so bad in Bangladesh that the people will have to avoid public transport,” he told bdnews24.com. ‘Shrabon’, a motorcycle driver who provides ridesharing services, said the company has provided him with a helmet which the passengers use. He said he mops the helmet with a tissue or a piece of cloth after every passenger gets down as a precaution, but he is not sure whether it is enough. Shrabon said he was aware that hand sanitisers can kill the coronavirus, but it was too costly for him to use as the prices have already shot up amid fears of the coronavirus.    “It’s easy to be aware at home, but whenever I go out, I bump into others. I can’t avoid this no matter how desperate I'm,” he said. Abdul Alim, a chicken seller at Rampura kitchen market, wore a mask. He said he has been using it to protect himself from dust much before the coronavirus outbreak started. He resigned himself to his fate. “What shall we do if we get infected? Nothing. We have Allah.”"

Students go on hunger strike demanding DU shutdown over coronavirus,15 March 2020 04:05 PM,A group of Dhaka University students have gone on hunger strike to demand the closure of the campus amid growing fears over the spread of coronavirus infection.,"Four students launched the strike at the altar of the Raju Memorial Sculpture on campus on Saturday night and were joined by another on Sunday morning. The protesters are Hasan Biswas, Jonaid Hossain, Yasin Arafat Plabon, Arafatul Osmani and Rakib Rana Masum -- all third year students in different departments of the university. “Although no one in the university has been infected with the coronavirus as of now, we, the students are the most vulnerable. We have to be on the alert everywhere, be it the hostels or classrooms,” Hasan, one of the strikers, told bdnews24.com. “Bangladesh has already reported a few cases of the coronavirus. Therefore, our campus should be closed before it spreads here. We had to go on hunger strike as it is a grave matter.” The university authorities are yet to address their concerns, he complained. “At least 40 of us live in a room that has space for four people. It's the same in the classroom. The coronavirus spreads rapidly. At least a thousand of us will be infected in an hour if anyone around us catches it. Therefore, we want the university to be closed,” said another protester Junaid. Another group of students also called on the university authority to temporarily halt academic programmes on the campus and create awareness to prevent the spread of the virus during a human-chain protest on Sunday. Students in some departments have also boycotted the classes and exams in fear of contracting the coronavirus. According to the university's Facebook group, students from 33 departments boycotted classes and exams. “This is not an issue that warrants a hunger strike. Rather, it is a national and international issue. The state will decide accordingly,” Dhaka University Vice Chancellor Md Akhtaruzzaman told bdnews24.com. “The students don’t have any ill-intention. We must take a decision that serves the interests of the university, the country and that ensures the greater good. We’re monitoring the situation but won't be drawn into taking a rash decision.” Bangladesh reported its first confirmed cases of the coronavirus on Mar 8 after detecting the infection in two men and a woman.

It is however, reporting more imported cases than those transmitted domestically now with Europe as the epicentre of the pandemic."
Quarantined Bangladeshi returnees from Italy demonstrate in Gazipur,15 March 2020 11:09 PM,A group of expatriate Bangladeshis from coronavirus-ravaged Italy have demonstrated on the premises of a quarantine facility in Gazipur after breaking the gate of the building.,"The government took 48 returnees to the facility, a centre with 20 seats for care of mothers and children, in the city’s Pubail on Saturday night after they arrived at Dhaka’s Shahjalal International Airport. Abdullah Al Jaki, the executive officer of Gazipur Sadar Upazila, said the expatriates asked officials on Sunday afternoon why the returnees were kept in captivity though they had done nothing wrong. “Arguing that they send in a huge amount of foreign currency, the expatriates started to demonstrate. At one stage, they broke down the collapsible gate and came out,” he said. Pubail Police Station OC Md Nazmul Haque Bhuiyan said additional police personnel were deployed there on the news of the demonstration and “vandalism”. “The situation is normal now,” he said.

How effective home quarantine is for Bangladesh to fight coronavirus,16 March 2020 04:49 AM,"Many expatriates who have flown in to Bangladesh recently are reportedly not isolating themselves at home going against, the government advice, raising fears of a coronavirus outbreak.","The country has reported five cases of COVID-19, the illness caused by the virus. Four of them had recently returned from abroad – three from Italy and one from Germany. The other is a close contact of one of the returnees from Italy. Europe is now the epicentre of the global pandemic with Italy the worst affected country. Bangladesh on Saturday night announced a two-week suspension on entry of passengers from the European countries, except the UK, to stop importing coronavirus cases. Foreign Minister AK Abdul Momen on Sunday said the decision was driven by the angry protests by over 100 people before they were released from a quarantine facility, a step the authorities appear to have made reluctantly. More than 600,000 people have entered the country since Jan 21 when the virus started to spread from China. The government urged all the travellers who have entered Bangladesh recently to self-quarantine and formally asked over 2,000 of them to quarantine themselves at home for 14 days, the incubation period of the virus, to stop a possible spread.    “We can’t tell them anything because they are our relatives. But panic has set in among all of us. Maybe they are not infected, but they should have been alert,” said a resident of the area. “You can catch a shoal of fry from a bucket, but you can’t catch the shoal when you release them with the others in a pond,” virologist Professor Dr Nazrul Islam told bdnews24.com, speaking about the release of the returnees after hours of quarantine. A lack of awareness can lead to a deadly coronavirus epidemic in Bangladesh, the former vice chancellor of the Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University fears. “It’s alright for the people in home quarantine to be told to follow the guidelines properly. But what if they don’t do it?” he asked, questioning the government decision to limit its duty to asking the people to self-quarantine. He said the others at the homes being used as quarantine may also get catch the virus if they do not use proper equipment for protection. Nazrul advised institutional quarantine for the people returning from coronavirus-hit countries. He said educational institutions, besides hospitals, can also be used as quarantine facilities. On Sunday, the government toughened its stance in a bid to make the returnees follow the guidelines to the letter. A man from Saudi Arabia was penalised in Manikganj for not self-isolating at home. Meerjady Sabrina Flora, the director at the government’s Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research, said the authorities have kept with them the passports of the returnees from Italy who went home. “Our local committees are monitoring them. But it will be difficult to tackle a pandemic if the people don’t cooperate. We didn’t want to use force so as to ensure the people’s enthusiastic participation. That’s why we asked them to be in home quarantine,” she said. “If they still wouldn’t listen to us, we will take a hardline. We will take appropriate measures for institutional quarantine if the breach of rules continues,” she added."

Govt tightens quarantine requirement for overseas returnees,17 March 2020 02:23 AM,The government is stepping up its efforts to limit the spread of the novel coronavirus by promising to clamp down on people returning from abroad who fail to self-isolate after the number of confirmed cases in the country rose to eight.,"The cabinet decided to impose a mandatory 14-day quarantine on all travellers arriving in Bangladesh from overseas. The government’s disease control agency, the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR), has warned that anyone disobeying the requirement will face stringent measures, including fines. Foreign Minister AK Abdul Momen reiterated the government's stance after foreign diplomats raised concerns over reports of overseas returnees roaming freely in the country. Home Minister Asaduzzaman Khan Kamal also warned of action from law-enforcement against those who disobey the quarantine requirement. The Directorate General of Health Services has issued several directives on 'home quarantine' aimed at returnees from abroad. More than 100 Bangladeshis were evacuated from the Chinese of Wuhan, the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak, and were kept in quarantine at Dhaka's Ashkona Hajj Camp in January. They were released after 14 days as their tests for the virus returned negative results. The virus has since spread to over 118 countries around the world with Europe becoming its current epicentre. It has infected more than 162,000 people and killed over 6,000 globally.    In the meantime, the country confirmed its first cases of the coronavirus after three people -- two of whom had returned from Italy -- tested positive for the infection. The number of cases went up to eight on Monday, among whom, three are relatives of a Bangladeshi expatriate from Italy. Nearly 300 Bangladeshis returned from Italy, the worst-affected country in Europe, between Saturday and Sunday. But most of them refused to be placed in institutional quarantine while there were also reports that many others who came back earlier had been out and about, prompting the strict measures from the cabinet. Speaking after the cabinet meeting chaired by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina on Monday, Cabinet Secretary Khandker Anwarul Islam said, ""Whoever returns from abroad, be it from a government programme, training or ordinary people, will have to undergo a mandatory 14-day quarantine without exception."" Anyone failing to comply with the order will face action under the Infectious Diseases (Prevention, Control And Elimination) Act, warned Anwarul. The law prescribes up to three months in jail and a fine of up to Tk 50,000 for anyone who obstructs the government's efforts to control an infectious disease or disobeys an order. The cabinet secretary highlighted a Tk 10,000 fine imposed on a returnee from Saudi Arabia in Mankikganj and said, ""Rangpur's divisional commissioner returned to the country on Monday. He has been told that he has to quarantine himself for 14 days.    IEDCR Director Meerjady Sabrina Flora said district-level committees have been directed to be uncompromising on the enforcement of the mandatory quarantine. According to the IEDCR, more than 606,012 people have come back to Bangladesh from abroad until Mar 15, with 9,965 returning in the 24 hours to Monday noon. Apart from the three international airports, many have entered the country through land and sea ports. It has come to the IEDCR's attention that many returnees from abroad have taken part in social gatherings, said Flora. The IEDCR stressed the need to raise awareness about the risks among family members of returnees and warned that an outbreak would be hard to prevent if self-isolation is not ensured. ""Once again we are requesting those who returned from abroad to distance themselves from their family members. We will be able to isolate them from society through the steps that we're taking. If they cannot be isolated from family members then it will be difficult to prevent an outbreak. In that case, we'll have to enforce institutional quarantines."""

Two foreign nationals denied entry into Bangladesh amid coronavirus scare,17 March 2020 08:49 PM,Authorities at Dhaka's Shahjalal International Airport have denied two foreign nationals entry into Bangladesh in a bid to stem the spread of the coronavirus.,"The citizens travelling from the United States and Ivory Coast were sent back early on Tuesday, Immigration authorities said. They were barred entry as Bangladesh has banned visas-on-arrival for all countries for two weeks due to the coronavirus. “They arrived at the airport without visa around 12 or 1am on Tuesday. But we have sent them back to their countries due to the ban on visas-on-arrival,” said Director of the airport AHM Touhid-ul Ahsan. On Saturday, Bangladesh decided to bar air passengers from all European countries, except Britain, to limit the spread of COVID-19.

The total number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the Indian subcontinent rose overnight to 482 as authorities across the region imposed travel restrictions to block the fast-spreading disease that has infected nearly 200,000 people worldwide and killed nearly 8,000 people. There are fears that inadequate health facilities will be overwhelmed in many parts of the poor, crowded region. Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan, in a late Tuesday address to the nation, urged citizens to remain calm and not rush to get tested. ""Even the US doesn't have the resources to test everyone who comes,"" he said. ""Only those with intense symptoms should go to hospital."" ""There is no need to worry. We will fight this as a nation. And God-willing, we will win this war,"" Khan said. His comments came amid a growing dispute in Pakistan between federal and provincial authorities with the latter struggling to secure sufficient coronavirus testing kits and blaming the federal government for failing to properly test and quarantine hundreds of Pakistanis who recently returned home across a land border with Iran. Late on Tuesday, Pakistan said it would require all arriving air passengers to show they had tested negative for the disease. Land borders have already been shut. Pakistan's central bank cut its key interest rate by 75 bps to 12.50% on Tuesday, the first cut in four years, as the coronavirus roiled markets across the region. Sri Lanka, which has recorded 43 coronavirus cases, said it would ban all incoming flights for two weeks from Wednesday to combat the spread of the virus. Officials also implemented price controls on lentils and sardines to ensure that no price gouging. Sri Lanka also said its stock market would remain shut for the rest of the week as it attempts to minimise interactions and curb the disease. In India, where 147 cases of the coronavirus have been confirmed, authorities on Tuesday cancelled nearly two dozen long distance train services in a bid to curb the disease and also because of a fall in passenger numbers.

Bangladesh reports first coronavirus death,18 March 2020 03:56 PM,"Bangladesh has reported the first coronavirus death in the country with almost 200,000 infections in 164 countries and territories and over 8,400 fatalities.","The patient, 70, was also suffering from a combination of diabetes, hypertension, and kidney and lung ailments, the disease control agency says. The number of patients with coronavirus infections rose to 14 from 10 previously in the country, Meerjady Sabrina Flora, director of Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research, said in a briefing on Wednesday. The person was infected with the coronavirus after meeting an overseas returnee. The patient also went through a procedure of heart stenting. The patient had been in intensive care, said the IEDCR director. “The patient belonged to the high-vulnerability group,” Flora said. Of the four new cases, three are male and the other female. Ten of the patients are undergoing treatment in isolation in hospital. The first three patients reported on Mar 8 have returned home after recovery. The new cases include two returnees from Italy, one from Kuwait and a family member of one of the returnees. Local authorities said one of the new Italy returnee patients was quarantined with dozens of others in a facility in Gazipur. The authorities kept in isolation 16 people who came to close contact of the patients while 42 others were in institutional quarantine, Flora said. The IEDCR collected specimens of 341 suspected patients so far, including 49 in the 24 hours to Wednesday noon. Two of the first three cases were returnees from Italy and the other was a family member of one of the returnees. Four others were kept in isolation at the time. The authorities confirmed two more cases on Mar 14 – a returnee from Italy and the other from Germany. From one of them, two children and a woman of the family were infected, the IEDCR said on Monday. It reported the two latest cases, including the dead victim, on Tuesday.  Meerjady Sabrina Flora  RESPONSE The government has allocated Tk 500 million for health services to prevent the spread of coronavirus after the detection of the first cases in Bangladesh. Most of the fund, over Tk 455 million, is for purchase of equipment. The rest will be used to raise public awareness and buy chemical re-agents. Flora had said Bangladesh designed a three-level alert system to tackle the coronavirus. The first had been an initial alert level when no coronavirus case had been reported, which Bangladesh has already passed. The authorities would switch to the second level when the first cases came from abroad. The next phase would be in place if the number of coronavirus cases increases, Flora had said. The government closed the door to travellers from the European countries, except Britain, for two weeks from Monday after Europe was declared the epicentre of the pandemic. Returnees from foreign countries have been ordered to go into mandatory home quarantine for 14 days, the incubation period of the virus. Several people have been punished for breaking quarantine rules as the government is going tough to keep the returnees away from others. Schools, colleges and all other educational institutions have been shut until Mar 31.

Gemelli Policlinico/Handout via REUTERS  PANDEMIC The world's richest nations prepared more costly measures to combat the global fallout of the coronavirus that has triggered social restrictions unseen since World War Two and sent economies spinning toward recession, Reuters reported. All 50 states in the US have reported cases, with the total number of known infections surging past 6,400. President Donald Trump’s administration pressed on Tuesday for enactment of a $1 trillion stimulus package, possibly to include $1,000 direct payments to individual Americans. Trump and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau have agreed to close the US-Canada border to all non-essential travel in an attempt to curb the coronavirus spread. Canada is unveiling a C$27 billion ($19 billion) aid package to help overcome the effects of the outbreak. In Europe, the lockdown in worst-affected Italy might be extended if the incidence of new cases doesn't slow, officials said. Since the restrictions were ramped up on March 12, the number of cases has more than doubled to 31,506 and the death toll more than tripled to 2,503. France has put its 67 million people under lockdown and says it is ready to nationalise big companies suffering financial turmoil while Spain has announced a 200 billion euro package to help companies and protect workers and other vulnerable groups. Britain launched a new lending scheme to provide short-term bridging finance for large businesses. Mainland China had 13 new cases on Tuesday, down from 21 a day earlier. Of the new cases, 12 involved travellers arriving from abroad. That brings the total number of confirmed cases in mainland China so far to 80,894. The death toll from the outbreak in mainland China reached 3,237, up by 11 from the previous day. Malaysia has warned of a fresh wave of infections if people do not follow two-week movement restrictions that started on Wednesday after its cases rose to 673, the highest in Southeast Asia. India said on Wednesday that 276 citizens have tested positive for coronavirus overseas, most of them in Iran, where the death toll climbed to 1,135 with 147 new deaths, while the total number of infections reached 17,361.

Bangladesh suspends cultural activities after first coronavirus death,18 March 2020 07:38 PM,Sammilita Sangskritik Jote has said all cultural activities and gatherings will remain suspended all over Bangladesh until the coronavirus situation normalises as COVID-19 has claimed the first life in the country.,"The central body of all cultural organisations announced the pause in a statement hours after the authorities reported the first coronavirus fatality on Wednesday. Its President Golam Kuddus and General Secretary Hasan Arif urged all the units of the Jote and cultural organisations at district and Upazila levels to stop organising functions in the statement. Programmes on a limited scale can be organised on the Mar 26 Independence Day and other national days, the statement said.

But no crowds will be allowed,” he said. “All [cultural] activities will be suspended until the state ensures our safety. The cultural activists will take part in any awareness programme if the authorities ask,” he added. The coronavirus outbreak has put a cloud of uncertainty over the Mangal Shobhajatra and Chhayanaut’s flagship Pahela Baishakh event at Ramna Batamul on Bangla New Year. Arif said they were yet to make a decision on the programmes. “We are thinking about organising these behind closed doors,” he said.

"Coronavirus triggers panic buying in Dhaka as stocks drop to 7-year low, gold prices fall",19 March 2020 03:48 AM,People rushed to stock up on groceries in Dhaka on Wednesday as stocks plunged to a seven-year low and jewellers cut gold prices amid fears of a coronavirus outbreak.,"More customers than usual crowded the groceries and kitchen markets in the capital’s Agargaon, Mirpur and Mohakhali and they were buying more goods than normal. “The customers who had been buying 10kg rice at a time previously are going for 20 to 30kg now. They are buying 2 to 3kg lentil in place of 1kg. We trying to ration as the heightened demand has already hit supplies,” said ‘Sohag’, an employee of Prince Bazar in Mirpur.  Grocery sales in Dhaka rise severalfold on Wednesday as a coronavirus outbreak prompts panic buying.  “I managed  to buy 12 sacks of rice on Tuesday after putting in a lot of efforts, but did not need to take the supply inside my shop as the customers booked all. They took it home from the van,” he said.  Panicked customers buy rice for stockpiling in Dhaka's Mirpur on Wednesday as the number of coronavirus patients rises in Bangladesh.  Commerce Minister Tipu Munshi also sees no reason behind a squeeze in supply of imported goods, which he says is 25 to 30 percent more than the previous year. The government will act against anyone trying to cash it on the coronavirus crisis, the ministers warned. Md Mohiuddin of wholesaler Janani Rice Agency in Mirpur also said there was actually no shortage of supply. “The mills could not match the sharp increase in demand. But the problem will go away soon because there is enough rice in stock,” he said. Monjur Mohammad Shahriar, the director of Dhaka zone at the Directorate of National Consumer Rights Protection, said they sent seven teams to the markets to alert the customers to the risks of stockpiling.    The key index of the Dhaka Stock Exchange lost 168.6 points or 4.47 percent to 3603.95. The previous low was at 3559.25 on May 9, 2013. With Wednesday’s plunge, the DSEX shed a total of 628 points or 14.83 percent in four trading days. Professor Mizanur Rahman, who teaches accounting at the Dhaka University, told bdnews24.com that the Bangladesh Bank should take steps to increase liquidity in order to allay fears of the coronavirus outbreak’s impact on the economy. “The economy must be provided with cash through the purchase of government bonds. The banks will have to be asked to buy shares then,” he said.    A month after raising gold prices citing the coronavirus, the jewellers have now cut the prices of the yellow metal citing the same reason. The new prices, with a Tk 1,166 cut per Bhori (11.664 grams) across the board, will be effective from Thursday, Bangladesh Jewellers Samity or Bajus said in an announcement on Wednesday. “The global gold market has been instable for some days. The downtrend is much visible in the UK market. So we’ve decided to cut the prices to adjust with the international market,” Bajus General Secretary Dilip Kumar Agarwala explained. New gold prices (per Bhori): 22 carat – Tk 60,361 21 carat – Tk 58,028 18 carat – Tk 53,013 For the traditional method, in which gold is acquired from old ornaments but there is no standard of purity, the price remains unchanged at Tk 40,241 per Bhori."
"Patients with fever, cold ‘overlooked’ in Dhaka hospitals amid coronavirus fears",19 March 2020 04:56 AM,"Many patients with fever, cold and breathing problems – which are also COVID-19 symptoms – have gone untreated as the hospitals in Dhaka are sending them to the IEDCR for coronavirus test. But the agency says the test is available for only returnees or their close contacts.","Shahani Khatun took her 14-year-old son to the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research on Wednesday for the coronavirus test as prescribed by the doctors for outpatients at the Shaheed Suhrawardy Medical College Hospital. “They [doctors] insisted that there would be no need for writing about the test in the prescription. They said the test would be conducted here whenever we come. But the people here [IEDCR] say they don’t conduct the test,” a confused Shahani said. ‘Ubaidul’, an employee of a firm at Banani, said doctors at the Dhaka Medical College Hospital had sent him to Kurmitola General Hospital for coronavirus test. The Kurmitola hospital forwarded him to the government’s disease control agency, the lone facility with the capacity to conduct the coronavirus test in Bangladesh. “The IEDCR says they conduct the test only on returnees,” the patient with flu-like symptoms said.    She had called the IEDCR on its hotlines so that the medics could collect specimens but no one received the calls. She then took her mother to the Kurmitola hospital that forwarded them to the IEDCR. The IEDCR refused to test her mother for the coronavirus, saying it tests people who had recently returned home from abroad or their close contacts. Mirza Nazim Uddin, the director of the Square Hospital, said they had prescribed the coronavirus test for Chaity’s mother as they had suspected that she had contacted it. “We had sent her there as per the government instruction that requires us ti inform it if any patient with such symptoms come to us,” he said. Meerjady Sabrina Flora, the director at the IEDCR, said she was hearing about such incidents for a long time. “Maybe the doctors refuse to treat these patients out of the fear that they would catch the coronavirus,” she said. The Suhrawardy hospital has launched an over-the-counter system to prescribe medications to patients with flu-like symptoms to avoid the risk of contacting the coronavirus. “We are thinking about what we can do to encourage the doctors. Our director for hospitals is looking into the issue. We are trying our best,” Flora said."

Two of them are suffering from fever while another is showing symptoms of mild fever. The victims have been hospitalised. Prof Abul Kalam Azad, director general of Directorate General of Health Services, shared the information in a briefing on Thursday. The infected woman is aged 22 and the men are aged 65 and 32. ""These are all cases of local transmission and the patients belong to the same family. They came into contact with an Italy returnee in the family who was already infected.” The woman has mild symptoms, said the director general. The other two patients have fever and receiving treatment in the hospital, Azad said adding the patients have no other ailments. There are 19 people kept in isolation at present, while 43 people in quarantine, he said.

The patient already suffered from chronic pulmonary disease, diabetes, hypertension and kidney ailments. He went through a stenting procedure too."
Malaysia seeks Rohingyas for coronavirus checks after mosque outbreak,19 March 2020 01:24 PM,"Malaysian authorities are scrambling to track down about 2,000 Rohingya men who attended a Muslim religious gathering that has led to a big spike in coronavirus cases across Southeast Asia, a security source and two other people told Reuters.","More than 100,000 Rohingyas live in Malaysia after fleeing from Myanmar, but they are considered illegal immigrants. Their status would likely make many of them reluctant to identify themselves to get tested for the coronavirus even if they showed symptoms, other sources, in the Rohingya community, said. Malaysia's search for the Rohingyas highlights the challenge for governments trying to track the virus among communities living without official papers and wary of authorities. The religious gathering late last month at a mosque on the outskirts of the Malaysian capital of Kuala Lumpur was attended by some 16,000 people, including the Rohingya Muslims from Myanmar, one source said. As well as the Rohingyas, about 1,500 Muslims from across Asia attended. Nearly 600 coronavirus cases in Southeast Asia have been linked to the gathering, including 513 in Malaysia, 61 in Brunei, 22 in Cambodia, at least five in Singapore and two in Thailand. Malaysia has 790 coronavirus cases in all. Malaysian authorities have been tracking down the participants but say they have been unable to find about 4,000 of them. ""They have gone back to their families across Malaysia, it has become difficult for us to contact them. Many are afraid of admitting that they attended, they fear they will get into problems with the authorities,"" one of the sources, who works with the refugee community, said. ""The government is concerned that if they don't come forward, the infection might spread further."" 'SEEK MEDICAL ATTENTION' The government had asked the police criminal investigation division to look for the missing participants, the security source said. Police declined to comment and directed queries to the Malaysian National Security Council under the prime minister's office. It could not immediately be reached for comment. Malaysia implemented travel curbs and shut down non-essential businesses from Wednesday for two weeks to contain the coronavirus after the spike in cases linked to the mosque gathering. One person who attended the gathering died from COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, this week. Participants spent most of their time crowded into the mosque for the four-day event, but some went to restaurants, shopping malls and Kuala Lumpur's landmark Petronas twin towers, according to Reuters interviews with people who attended and social media posts. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in Malaysia told Reuters it had heard that refugees and asylum-seekers were at the gathering and it was working with the Ministry of Health to ensure that all refugee and asylum-seeking communities were included in government response measures. ""Refugees and asylum-seekers are advised to seek medical attention if they present symptoms of COVID-19 infection, regardless of whether they were present at events like the mentioned religious gathering,"" UNHCR Malaysia said in an email. The Ministry of Health did not respond to requests for comment. A 39-year Rohingya father of four, who lives in the Malaysian state of Penang, said he spent days at the mosque event with nearly two dozen Rohingya friends. He said none of them was showing any symptoms and he went to a hospital but no test was done. ""Everything's fine, no fever nothing,"" the construction worker said. Reuters is withholding his name to protect his identity. Salman, a Bangladeshi construction worker who lives near the mosque, said he and many other Bangladeshis went to the gathering. His coronavirus test was negative but the hospital calls him daily to check if he has symptoms, Salman said. ""When I went for testing, they didn’t ask for passport or work permit or any documents. They just asked for my name, age and address,"" said Salman, who declined to give his full name."

The situation was worsening in Madaripur and Faridpur districts and in particular, Shibchar Upazila, according to Malik. “They have more patients with the symptoms than in the other areas. Most of the 17 infected are from the region. So we are considering it vulnerable, critical,” he said. “We will lock these areas down if the number of cases rises,” the minister said and added, “This is the best way to control this disease.”"
"SC makes courts off-limits to prisoners, suspects amid virus risks",19 March 2020 05:49 PM,The Supreme Court has ordered the authorities not to produce prisoners and suspects in courts for legal proceedings amid growing coronavirus risks.,"“The presence of prisoners and suspects in courts for legal proceedings is highly unsafe amid the risk of COVID-19,” the top court said in a statement on its website on Thursday. The decision came after Bangladesh confirmed three new cases of coronavirus, taking the total to 17. “Legal proceedings of the cases will be held keeping the prisoners and suspects in jail. In case of other circumstances, the proceedings should be suspended if necessary.” “The order will take effect immediately and it will remain in force until further notice,” the statement said. The government has already shut all forms of events and mass-gatherings to curb the spread of infectious disease. All educational institutions, archaeological sites and museums, cinemas and cultural events have been closed due to coronavirus."
"India bans incoming flights to rein in coronavirus, seals off Kashmir",19 March 2020 07:58 PM,"India banned incoming international flights on Thursday, restricted public gatherings and blocked roads to seal Kashmir after the insurgency-torn region reported its first coronavirus infection.","Elsewhere in densely populated South Asia, Sri Lanka postponed parliamentary elections as the coronavirus epidemic spread in an area that had been relatively unscathed compared to elsewhere in the world. New cases in India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka are all accelerating, with the total across the region nearing 700. Six people have died. Authorities worry that these countries could be especially at risk should the virus begin to spread locally, due to poor health facilities and infrastructure. India, the world's second most populous country after China, said it would ban all international commercial passenger flights from landing from Sunday for a week. The country has already suspended visas for the vast majority of foreigners seeking to enter. In Indian-ruled Kashmir, claimed in whole but ruled in part by both India and Pakistan, dozens of people told Reuters they had been prevented from leaving their neighbourhoods by police and paramilitary units. Srinagar's senior superintendent of police, Haseeb Mughal, told Reuters that road blockades across the valley had been imposed to prevent the spread of the virus. ""I had to take my mother to hospital in Srinagar but the police closed the road,"" said Mohammed Ayub, from the nearby town of Budgam. ""I am waiting here for the last two hours. I can't even go home now as the road is blocked due to a traffic jam."" Muslim-majority Kashmir has been relatively unaffected by the virus, reporting its first case on Wednesday. But the picturesque valley of seven million is one of most militarised places on earth due a decades-long insurgency against Indian rule, and its residents have been subject to prolonged curbs on movement. An internet shutdown that began in August following sweeping constitutional changes in Kashmir has only just been eased. ELECTION SHELVED Sri Lanka said on Thursday it would delay parliamentary elections scheduled for April 25. The island nation banned all incoming flights for two weeks effective Wednesday and imposed a curfew in some areas. There have been 53 confirmed cases in Sri Lanka. Confirmed cases in Afghanistan remained static at 22 on Thursday, despite what experts say is a brewing crisis in the war-torn nation, especially in Herat province bordering Iran, one of the worst affected countries. In India, several areas introduced curbs on gatherings as coronavirus cases rose to 166. Late on Wednesday, the desert state of Rajasthan invoked colonial-era laws that prevent the unlawful assembly of four or more people - powers more often used to quell riots. Similar restrictions were introduced in Noida, a satellite city of New Delhi. The financial hub of Mumbai expanded its partial shutdown of offices to government buildings on Thursday, with at least half the staff ordered to work from home. Online retailers say they are struggling to keep up with demand as consumers stockpile supplies. ""We are seeing unprecedented order volumes in all cities in India,"" said Hari Menon, chief executive of online grocery retailer BigBasket. The spread of the virus continued to hit markets and companies across the region. The Indian and Sri Lankan currencies both fell to a record lows against the dollar, with Pakistan stocks hitting their lowest level in five years. Indian airline IndiGo said it would cut the salaries of most of its staff, while rivals SpiceJet and Vistara suspended international flights. Since emerging late last year in the Chinese city of Wuhan, the flu-like coronavirus has infected more than 218,000 people and killed nearly 9,000.

Thousands mass defying government to pray for coronavirus prevention in Bangladesh,19 March 2020 08:13 PM,"When countries are locking down, thousands of people have gathered in Lakshmipur for special prayer session to prevent coronavirus outbreak despite the government’s directive to avoid mass gatherings.","The special prayer session ‘Khatme Shifa’ took place following the Fazr or early morning prayer on Wednesday at Haiderganj Aheria Rachimuddin Central Eidgah premises in Raipur Upazila. Haiderganj Sayed Manzil organised the special prayer while Andarkilla Shahi Jam-e- Mosque Khatib Syed Md Anwar Hossain Taher Al Zabiri  Al Madani it. During the prayer, the devotees sought the protection of the people around the world from the coronavirus pandemic. No permission was taken from the authorities to hold the event, the district administration said. Many countries around the world have closed their borders and shut down cities to prevent the coronavirus outbreak that spread over more than 174 countries. People are even slapped with fine if they leave their homes without any emergency. Saudi Arabia has stopped congregation in mosques apart from the two major mosques in Makkah and Madina to avoid the crowd. Kuwait opted for the same measure. They requested everyone to offer their prayer at home. The government ordered the people to avoid mass gathering after Bangladesh reported its first coronavirus case on Mar 8. Health Minister Zahid Malik urged postponement of Waz Mahfil and any religious gatherings across the country after more coronavirus cases were reported. “We haven’t issued any permission to hold such an event. We don’t know how they did it. We have directed the Raipur Upazila Nirbahi Officer to issue a show cause notice to the organisers,” said Lakshmipur Deputy Commissioner Anjan Chandra Pal. They were ‘unaware’ of the issue, Lakshmipur Police Superintendent AH Kamruzzaman said. “And this wasn’t a congregation. People just took part in the Munajat following the Fazr prayers,” he said. People from different Upazilas streamed in before the Fazr prayers, witnesses said. The entire Eidgah premises was filled with people by sunrise. They all prayed together. The ‘Khatme Shifa’ was held from Fazr prayers to 7am, said Inspector Belayet Hossain of the local police outpost. Police were unaware of the event beforehand, he said. Raipur Police Station OC Tota Mia reiterated the same. bdnews24.com could not contact mosque committee General Secretary Syed Taher Zabiri after repeated attempt."
Muslim event in Indonesia stopped amid coronavirus fears,19 March 2020 08:49 PM,"A rally of Muslim pilgrims that is drawing thousands of people to Indonesia has been stopped amid fears that it could help spread the new coronavirus, an official said.","But elsewhere in Indonesia, a Christian gathering went ahead with more than 1,000 people despite official discouragement of big religious meetings. The world's most populous Muslim-majority country has reported less than 300 coronavirus cases but there are suspicions many have gone undetected and medical workers have accused the government of a ""half-hearted"" response. For days, authorities had been trying to persuade Ijtima Asia, part of the global Tablighi Jama'at movement of evangelical Muslims, to halt the event at Gowa near the city of Makassar in South Sulawesi province after a similar event in Malaysia led to hundreds of infections. ""Alhamdulillah (Praise be to God), Ijtima finally agreed to postpone/cancel,"" the head of Gowa regency, Adnan Purichta Ichsan, posted on social media late on Wednesday. The pilgrims already there would be isolated while they make arrangements to leave Gowa, he added. More than 8,500 people from across Indonesia, Asia and the Middle East had converged on the area. After resisting the closure of the event and defiantly stating ""we are more afraid of God"" than the coronavirus on Wednesday, organiser Mustari Bahranuddin said he would follow the directive to cancel the prayer rally. But he said it would be difficult to quickly disperse the crowd, many of whom had arrived by ferry. ""We need a process to send the participants home,"" he told Reuters on Thursday. ""The ship has it's own schedule."" The proselytising Tablighi Jama'at movement behind the gathering in Indonesia hosted an event in Malaysia from Feb. 27 to March 1 that drew 16,000 followers and led to more than 500 coronavirus infections. Photos and videos of the Indonesian gathering posted on social media showed huge crowds of men sitting tightly together in a huge tent. The attendees came from all parts of Indonesia, a sprawling archipelago of more than 250 million people. Hundreds more travelled from other Southeast Asian nations, as well as the Middle East, Pakistan and Bangladesh. CHRISTIAN CEREMONY While the Islamic festival ended, a big celebration for the ordination of a Catholic bishop on the island of Flores in eastern Indonesia proceeded, albeit on a smaller scale than anticipated. About 1,000 people joined the congregation, said provincial government spokesman Marius Ardu Jelamu, less than the 8,000 originally expected. A campaign to deter Catholics from attending had been effective and precautions were taken to minimise the chances of contagion, he added. Indonesia's tally of coronavirus infections stood at 227, with 19 deaths, on Wednesday. However, the nation had run just 1,255 tests by Wednesday even though the World Health Organization warned the government earlier this month to scale up testing to prevent much higher infections in the future. Indonesian President Joko Widodo said on Thursday the country will ramp up testing and urged religious leaders to re-evaluate plans for large gatherings."

India's Modi wants citizens to impose curfew on Mar 22 to prevent spread of coronavirus,19 March 2020 09:23 PM,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi appealed to citizens to stay home and avoid panic buying, even as India outlined plans to halt all international flights and rushed to stem the spread of coronavirus cases in the country.","In a late night address to the nation on Thursday, Modi said people should leave ""their homes only if essential"" and he asked the nation to self-observe an all-day curfew on Sunday. Modi's plea came shortly after India said it plans to halt any incoming international flights from landing in the country as of 2001 GMT on March 22. Modi also urged Indians to stop panic buying and assured them there would be no shortage of essential goods. His appeal came as retailers said they were struggling to keep up with demand as consumers rush to stockpile supplies. ""We are seeing unprecedented order volumes in all cities in India,"" said Hari Menon, chief executive of online grocery retailer BigBasket. Densely populated South Asia has so far been relatively unscathed compared to many other parts of the world. But new COVID-19 cases in India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka are all accelerating, with the total across the region nearing 700. Six people have died. Authorities worry that these countries could be especially at risk should the virus begin to spread locally, due to poor health facilities and infrastructure. The spread of the virus continued to rattle markets across the region. The Indian and Sri Lankan currencies both fell to a record lows against the dollar on Thursday, while Pakistan's main stock index hit its lowest level in five years. ""The pandemic has severely affected the economy,"" said Modi, adding that he has set up a task force to assess the impact. ELECTION SHELVED Sri Lanka said on Thursday it would delay parliamentary elections that had been scheduled for April 25. Earlier this week, the island nation also sealed its borders and imposed a curfew in some areas. There have been 59 confirmed cases in Sri Lanka. In a bid to stem a sharp slide in the Sri Lankan rupee, the nation's central bank on Thursday ordered all banks to suspend funding imports of motor vehicles and non-essential goods. Meanwhile, confirmed cases in Afghanistan remained static at 22 on Thursday, despite what experts say is a brewing crisis in the war-torn nation, especially in Herat province, which borders Iran - one of the worst affected countries. Thousands have been crossing daily across the porous border in that region, with little testing being done on those entering the country, according to an official source. The number of confirmed cases in Pakistan surged on Thursday to 410. The increase is being driven by pilgrims returning from Iran. Some officials fear with thousands of pilgrims yet to be tested, cases could soar further in coming days. MASK EXPORTS BANNED India late on Thursday also banned the exports of surgical masks, ventilators and textiles used for masks and overalls, while several areas introduced curbs on gatherings as coronavirus cases rose to 173.

UK returnee AL leader Kamran was ‘unaware of home quarantine’,20 March 2020 03:57 AM,"Facing criticism for attending a national event of Mujib Barsha in Dhaka on his return from the coronavirus-hit Britain, Awami League leader Bodor Uddin Ahmed Kamran says no one at the airport told him about the 14-day home quarantine for returnees.","Netizens and opposition politicians slated the former mayor of Sylhet city as his photos attending events, including one with party chief Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina on Mar 17, went viral. In the US, President Donald Trump had to undergo coronavirus test after a Brazilian official, who had met Trump, tested positive for the contagious virus. The government has made it mandatory for returnees from foreign countries to self-quarantine at home for 14 days – the incubation period of the virus. The authorities have punished dozens of returnees for breaking the quarantine rules by going out of home. “Who will fine former Sylhet mayor Bodor Uddin Kamran? He joined a national event just after returning from the UK,” Fazlul Bari, an expatriate Bangladeshi in Australia, wrote on Facebook. “He needs to be sent to mandatory quarantine for his own and everyone else’s safety. His popularity will increase if he responds himself,” Bari added. BNP Senior Joint Secretary General Ruhul Kabir Rizvi accused the government of double standards in the case of Kamran. But Kamran told bdnews24.com he was “certain he is not infected with the virus”. “Because I had filled in the yellow form they had given me at the airport on arrival. They had checked me when I got off at the Sylhet airport. I don’t have any symptoms,” he said. He said his son, who is a doctor, was also enquiring about him all the time. “I don’t have any problem,” the former mayor said. The Awami League leader said he had attended the event of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman’s birth centenary because he was emotional about it. “And no one told me and the others on the same flight that we needed to be in quarantine. I didn’t know about it. I am staying at home, not going out, after I came to know about it,” he added."
Job cut fears as fashion brands slash orders in Bangladesh with coronavirus,20 March 2020 04:00 AM,"Factory workers in Bangladesh could go hungry as global fashion brands have cancelled or delayed orders worth $138 million due to coronavirus, manufacturers said on Thursday.","More than 100 Bangladeshi factories have already lost orders, manufacturers said, as retail sales plummeted globally and giants like Zara owner Inditex and H&M temporarily closed stores in Europe - the current epicentre of the flu-like virus. ""We are totally dependent on our export proceeds,"" said Rubana Huq, president of the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association, which has more than 4,000 members, describing coronavirus as the ""curse of the century"". ""(Our) plea to the brands has been to continue taking our orders until June. And to support us in any form so that the workers don't go hungry ... how will their lives and livelihood be sustained if there are cancellations?"" Bangladesh, the world's second largest garment supplier after China, is heavily-reliant on top fashion brands. The industry employs more than 4 million people, mostly women, and accounts for more than 80% of its exports. The world's wealthiest nations ramped up spending and poured unprecedented aid into the traumatised global economy on Thursday as coronavirus cases ballooned, prompting widespread emergency lockdowns. H&M said it had been hit by a drop in global demand but it was in close and transparent dialogue with its suppliers. ""Our long-term commitment to suppliers will remain intact,"" a spokesman told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in emailed comments. ""In this extreme situation we need to respond fast, together with our business partners, and take decisions that can be difficult in the short-term, but necessary in the long-term ... (and) find solutions that are suitable for all parties."" Labour activists said no workers had been fired as a result of coronavirus but they were afraid of losing their jobs. ""These workers live hand-to-mouth and they are panicked because they have heard that orders are being cancelled,"" Kalpona Akter, founder of the Bangladesh Centre for Worker Solidarity. Akter said workers were also scared of catching coronavirus, with Bangladesh reporting 17 cases and one death by Thursday. The International Labour Organization said in emailed comments that protective equipment, flexible working and better hygiene procedures were needed in Bangladesh's garment factories to prevent the spread of coronavirus. Huq said factories were exercising utmost caution and practising good hygiene. The government said this month that it would assess the economic damage caused by coronavirus before deciding on support packages for business."

The price was Tk 2,700 four days ago and Tk 2,400 last week. He claimed he could not buy rice from the wholesale market in the past two days due to excessive pressure of shoppers. “The wholesalers are selling directly to consumers at high prices. They [wholesalers] don’t have time for us now,” he said. “The customers are not even bargaining. They are paying whatever prices the wholesalers are asking,” said Sultan Ahmed, another rice trader in the area.    Prices of other goods have also increased. Egg was being sold at Tk 112 per dozen, up from Tk 92 a week ago. Lentil price rose to Tk 110 from Tk 102.

After a death from the coronavirus and cancellations of public gatherings, panic has set in and spread to the markets of Bangladesh. In fear, many have resorted to purchasing a month’s worth of food products causing a crisis in the market which in turn resulted in the price hikes of different staple foods, including rice. “I see some people buying stuffs and taking them home to stock. I saw a person buy 30kg of salt. I don’t know what he will do with 30kg of salt,” Hasina said after casting her vote in the by-poll to the Dhaka-10 parliamentary seats at Dhaka City College on Saturday. “The price of onions went up once, due to which many bought huge amounts of onions to stock. The result was that those onions rotted and were thrown away.” She called for easing pressure on the market and said, “Please don’t panic and gather according to your needs.” “We have 1.7 million tonnes of food in government stock. We have 350,000 tonnes of wheat in stock. In addition, non-government rice mills have a lot in stock and we also have crops in fields. “We can buy food worth a year with the kind of reserve that we have. So there should be no worries.” Saying that the government is keeping an eye out to keep the market stable, Hasina called for the public to stay aware and conscious."

A journalist asked whether it was reasonable to hold the briefing this way or the government should organise briefings online.    “But we have to respond to the call of duty for the country, its people. Even you and our workers have come in this holiday,” he added. Malik also said the government would try to limit the briefings with the help of information and communication technology. State Minister for ICT Zunaid Ahmed Palak briefed the media online on Friday. The Centre for Policy Dialogue held a media conference online via Facebook."
One dead in Sri Lanka jail clash as South Asia tries to stem virus,22 March 2020 02:02 AM,"One prisoner died and three others were injured when fighting broke out on Saturday in a Sri Lankan jail over rumours of coronavirus, as governments across South Asia tightened restrictions on movement to try to stem infections.","The pandemic appears to have been slow to take off in the region, home to 1.9 billion people, but the rate of infections in Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan, Sri Lanka, Maldives and Afghanistan is increasing. As a whole, by 1400 GMT on Saturday, the region had registered 957 coronavirus cases and eight deaths. Instructions to stay indoors are a challenge for millions of day labourers who can scarcely afford to stay at home, and there are fears that the region will prove particularly vulnerable because of its poor health facilities and overcrowded infrastructure. In Sri Lanka, which has confirmed 76 cases, police arrested 110 people from various parts of the country for violating a weekend curfew, a police spokesman said. In Anuradhapura prison, scene of frequent protests against ill-treatment in recent years, inmates fought staff, fearing that the virus had entered the jail. ""Contrary to rumours floating around, no one has tested positive at the Anuradhapura prison,"" said lawmaker Namal Rajapaksa. FLIGHTS SUSPENDED At Dum Dum, the largest jail in the eastern Indian state of West Bengal, police fired tear gas after prisoners attacked wardens and tried to start a fire after visits were banned because of the virus, a prison official said. In neighbouring Bangladesh, all incoming flights except those from China, Hong Kong and Thailand were to be banned from midnight onwards after 20 people tested positive, a senior civil aviation official said. At Dhaka airport, authorities started marking the hands of passengers who had been instructed to follow home quarantine. Pakistan, with 534 confirmed cases and three deaths, suspended all international flights for two weeks. Officials there said a self-quarantine programme would continue for at least another 45 days. In India's towns and cities, people were scrambling to buy essential commodities ahead of a day-long curfew on Sunday promoted by Prime Minister Narendra Modi as a way of practising social isolation. India is also banning all incoming international flights from 2001 GMT on Sunday. With over 1.3 billion people, India has confirmed 283 cases of coronavirus, but has tested only 15,000 samples in 70 state-run labs, according to a senior health ministry official in New Delhi, one of the lowest testing rates in the world. ""At this point we really don't know what is the extent of the spread,"" the official said, on condition of anonymity. Indian Railways, which carries more than 25 million passengers every day, said some people had tested positive after travelling by train, forcing officials to try to track down fellow passengers. Confirmed COVID-19 Cases in South Asia: Pakistan - 534 India - 283 Sri Lanka - 76 Afghanistan - 24 Bangladesh - 24 Maldives - 13 Nepal - 1 Bhutan - 2 ---------------------- TOTAL – 957"
